Be courteous to all, but intimate
with few; and let those few be
well tried before you give them
your confidence. True friendship
is a plant of slow growth,
and must undergo and withstand the shocks
of adversity before it is entitled to the appellation.
Let your heart feel for the afflictions
and distresses of every one, and let your hand
give in proportion to your purse; remembering
always the estimation of the widow’s
mite, that it is not every one that asketh that
deserveth charity; all, however, are worthy
of the inquiry, or the deserving may suffer.
Do not conceive that fine clothes make fine
men, any more than fine feathers make fine
birds. A plain, genteel dress is more admired,
and obtains more credit, than lace and embroidery,
in the eyes of the judicious
and sensible.—<span class='c008'><cite>From a Letter to His Nephew,

<h3 class='c010'>HOW FEMALE SUFFRAGE WORKS IN NEW ZEALAND.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Even Maori Women Vote, But Only Men Hold Office—Lack of Servants Keeps Fair Sex Home.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>What about woman in New Zealand?
We are arguing for and
against woman suffrage in the
United States with almost as much
theory and as little practical knowledge
of the proposed conditions as was the
case thirty years ago. Some of us are
positive in the conviction that the right
to vote would unsex the sex—would
harden motherhood and sisterhood into
a sedulous mannishness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Others believe that womanly intuitions
would soften the sheer practicality of
politics and induce gentleness where
roughness has ruled. And for a dozen
years we need only have looked to the
Antipodes to learn how woman suffrage
might work out in practise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Ward, wife of the premier of
New Zealand, during a recent visit to
the United States, said to a representative
of the New York <cite>Tribune</cite> that the
women of New Zealand, despite their
participation in colonial politics, are very
feminine. She added:</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes women do speak at political
meetings, but it generally turns out afterward
that they are visiting Americans,
or perhaps English women. No, we
don’t sit on juries, and we don’t run for
Parliament. The law would have to be
changed before we could do so, but I
don’t believe we want to. Perhaps some
time in the future it will come to that,
but I think it will be a long time.</p>

<p class='c015'>We did have a mayoress once in a town
in the northern part of the colony, but
no one seems inclined to repeat the experiment.
In fact, we are very busy with
our domestic affairs, and are quite content
for the present to leave the management
of public affairs to the men.</p>

<p class='c015'>The women of New Zealand place their
homes before every other consideration,
and their domestic problems are just as
serious as those of any other country.
Our young women would rather be stenographers
than domestic servants, and we
have not found any way of getting on
without servants.</p>

<p class='c015'>But don’t imagine that we are not interested
in politics and that we don’t
vote. There isn’t a woman in New Zealand
who doesn’t know every member of
Parliament either by sight or by reputation,
and there isn’t one who can’t talk
intelligently about political questions.
Out on the farms and in the villages it
is just the same as in the cities, and it
makes life very much more interesting.</p>

<p class='c015'>No matter whom you meet, you will always
find one subject of common interest.
People here don’t seem to be much interested
in politics, and even your men don’t
vote, I am told. Isn’t it strange? Perhaps
it is because our country is smaller that
we take so much more interest in its
affairs.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our elections are most interesting
events, and the women do a great deal
of electioneering, just as they do in England.
But they don’t do much speechmaking,
except among themselves. Political
afternoon teas are a favorite
method of winning over doubtful women
voters.</p>

<p class='c015'>What becomes of the babies when the
mothers are out electioneering? Why, I
really don’t know. I suppose there is always
some kind-hearted woman to take
care of them. Perhaps the women take
care of one another’s babies. I never
heard of any difficulties of that kind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Do the native women vote? Yes, certainly.
Every woman over twenty-one
votes. The only qualification is a residence
of twelve months in the colony
and three months in the electorate where
the vote is cast. The native women take
just as much interest in politics as the
white women, and are thoroughly well
posted in everything concerning native
affairs. We have an aboriginal population
of forty thousand, and they have
their own representatives in Parliament.</p>

<p class='c007'>Women in New Zealand have the more
time for politics because they do not
carry the burden of charitable work.
The charities there are subsidized by the
State.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>WIDENING SCOPE OF COLLEGE FRATERNITIES.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>C. F. Birdseye Believes They Bring Undergraduates More Under Influence of Alumni.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The American college fraternity has
become a farce, educational and
social, intellectual and moral, so
great that even but few fraternity leaders
appreciate it. At more than one college,
chapter-houses have done away
with the need of dormitories. As colleges
have grown larger and more unwieldy,
and the members of the faculties
have been less frequently in personal
touch with their students, the fraternities
have in no slight degree taken the place
of the old small-college units, alumni
now influencing the undergraduates
through their fraternities, much as the
professors used to.</p>

<p class='c013'>Writing in the <cite>Outlook</cite>, Clarence F.
Birdseye points out that our college fraternities
are to-day great educational influences:</p>

<p class='c014'>The pick of our alumni in wealth and
influence are fraternity men. If a tithe
of this power can be turned back into
the lives of the undergraduates to supplement
the efforts of the faculties, we
can do much to restore individualism.</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither college nor fraternity conditions
are at present ideal. They are often
bad, and there is real foundation for all
complaints. Unless promptly checked,
the evils will grow far worse and more
difficult to root out. This question must
be studied by its friends, and the reform
must come from the fraternity alumni;
for the fraternities can be awakened and
developed, but not driven, nor driven out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Like every other historical, educational,
or social question, this must be studied
carefully and with open minds by
many alumni and from different standpoints,
so as to cover widely divergent
conditions in institutions that may be
universities or colleges, rich or poor, large
or small, old and conservative or recent
and radical, public or private, at the
North, South, East, or West, and therefore
governed by widely different religious,
social, educational, and political
influences.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Wide Distribution of Chapters.</h4>

<p class='c017'>The wide distribution of its various
chapters adds greatly to the perspective
and corrective power of every fraternity,
and makes it an ideal instrument for
wisely investigating and righting undergraduate
conditions at the same time in
widely scattered institutions.</p>

<p class='c015'>The true fraternity alumnus can mold
the lives and motives of his younger
brothers. In most colleges the fraternities
are so strong that if we can change
the atmosphere of the fraternity houses,
which for four years are the undergraduates’
homes, we can change the whole
undergraduate situation.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fraternity alumni have contributed
hundreds of thousands of dollars for
housing and otherwise helping the undergraduates.
Every fraternity has many
loyal and devoted graduates who willingly
give time or money or both to the
true interests of their younger brothers,
and whose word is law to them.</p>

<p class='c015'>The character of the influence of each
chapter depends largely on the local
alumni, strengthened, guided, and impelled
by a strong central organization.
Why not apply modern business principles
and systematic organization to this
all-important problem?</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Atmosphere of Chapter-House.</h4>

<p class='c017'>We have one thousand seven hundred
fraternity chapters in three hundred and
sixty-three of our institutions of higher
learning as <i>foci</i> from which the good influences
might constantly and powerfully
radiate. There has been too much tendency
to make the fraternity the end and
not the means.</p>

<p class='c015'>The alumni have not realized that the
atmosphere of the chapter-house determines
the character of the chapter’s
influence on its individual members, and
that the ultimate responsibility for this
atmosphere is on the alumni. If we would
make this atmosphere permanently good,
we must appreciate that the alumni are
the permanent and the undergraduates
the transient body—completely changing
every three years; and the seniors, the
governing body, every year.</p>

<p class='c015'>We, as the permanent body, have no
right to furnish our undergraduates with
fine and exclusive homes, and then shirk
responsibility for the future conduct and
influence of those homes.</p>

<p class='c015'>The proper government of a chapter
is a strict one, with the power in the
hands of the upper classmen, especially
the seniors, who are in turn held strictly
accountable to alumni who are in constant
touch with the situation and personally
acquainted with every undergraduate
and his work and needs.</p>

<p class='c015'>Where such conditions are continuous,
the chapter’s success is assured, and the
effect on the undergraduates is highly
beneficial. The fraternities, through
strong central organizations, must make
these conditions prevalent and continuous
in every chapter. This has long been
the theory, but the practise has been
poor.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Correction of Waste.</h4>

<p class='c017'>The fraternities, with their numerous
chapters in different institutions, have
the best possible opportunities for the
investigation and correction of the wastes
and for the enforcement of economies in
college life.</p>

<p class='c015'>No one can measure the waste and lack
of economy, to the college, the fraternity,
the community, the family, or the individual,
of a failure in college life, from whatever
cause it comes.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is criminal that we have not studied
these wastes in our colleges as we have
in our factories, railroads, and other
great industries, and that we have allowed
the pendulum to swing so far to
the other side, and have not long ago
returned it to its mean, and found educational
influences to replace the small
units of the earlier colleges.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Birdseye maintains, in conclusion,
that it is for the fraternities to devote
their wealth and influence to improve undergraduate
conditions, incite their men
to the best work, and prevent the wastes
which result from a failure in college
lives.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE LATEST IDEA OF A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Professor Borgerhoff Points Out Some of the Merits of the Latest Invention, Esperanto.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>In the preface to his famous dictionary
Dr. Samuel Johnson wrote: “Language
is only the instrument of
science, and words are but the signs of
ideas.” If that be true, it is not strange
that man should so constantly seek to
improve the instrument. We have the
selective process by which worn-out
words and idioms are dropped into the
limbo of archaism and new coinages
come into use. Then we have the attempts
to supply new languages, ready-made.
There was Volapük; and now
comes Esperanto.</p>

<p class='c013'>Professor J. L. Borgerhoff, of the
Western Reserve University, sets forth
in the Atlanta <cite>Constitution</cite> the claims of
Esperanto as a world-language. After
brief reference to former candidate
languages, he says:</p>

<p class='c014'>The latest attempt, and the one which
bids fair to be final, is Esperanto, so
called by its author, Dr. Zamenhof, a
Russian physician, who under this pseudonym
published scientific articles before
he became famous as the inventor of an
artificial language.</p>

<p class='c015'>Zamenhof, like his predecessors in the
same field, was struck by the useless
wealth of idioms that divide the inhabitants
of the earth and make international
relations so difficult, while at the same
time they are a prolific source of misunderstanding
and enmity among the nations.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was also convinced that the reason
why the existing universal languages had
failed in their purpose was that they
were too difficult—almost as difficult as
the natural ones. The cause of their
difficulty lay in the grammar, which was
too intricate, and in the vocabulary, which
was far too varied. He forthwith composed
a grammar which was simplicity
itself; this he did by setting aside all
rules not strictly needed for the construction
of a logical sentence and by eliminating
all exceptions. The few remaining
grammatical principles may be learned in
half an hour.</p>

<p class='c015'>His next concern was the vocabulary.
What makes the acquisition of a foreign
vocabulary so hard to students is the
variety of roots, the great number of
different words. To take an instance
from English, to express the various
ideas suggested by the one conception of
death, we have: dead, to die, deadly, and
deathly, mortal, to kill, to murder, to assassinate,
to suicide, to commit homicide,
etc. What a cumbersome luxury of roots,
and how discouraging to the foreigner
who wishes to learn this language!</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Number of Roots Reduced.</h4>

<p class='c017'>And yet English is one of the easiest
of all European tongues. How to reduce
this number of roots was the great problem
before Zamenhof. He therefore took
one out of a number, and by means of a
system of suffixes and prefixes he made
this one root do duty for all the others.</p>

<p class='c015'>In this manner the Esperanto dictionary
contains only about two thousand roots,
yet they are sufficient to form, by means
of derivation, a vocabulary large enough
for all purposes.</p>

<p class='c015'>But what makes matters simpler still,
he chose his two thousand roots in such
a manner that they appear familiar to all
educated persons of European civilization,
by selecting first those terms which
are already in universal usage, like sport,
toilet, train; then by taking words common
to two or three leading languages,
and finally by adding to these a small
number of roots not international, but
picked out judiciously from various
idioms, so that any one, be he Slav,
Teuton, or Latin, finds that Esperanto has
a familiar appearance.</p>

<p class='c015'>The suffixes number about thirty and
the prefixes half a dozen; they have well
defined meanings, and once they are
known any person provided with a list
of the simple roots can compose his own
vocabulary almost <i>ad libitum</i>, so that the
finest shades of meaning may be expressed
to a nicety.</p>

<p class='c015'>I should say that the most remarkable
feature about Esperanto, and one which
no natural idiom possesses to such a degree,
is this power of forming new words
once the key-word is given, and it should
be remembered that in the majority of
instances this key-word is already known.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Simplicity a Striking Feature.</h4>

<p class='c017'>The second striking feature is the simplicity
and regularity of the whole grammatical
scheme; thus are placed within
easy reach two essential parts of a
language—the vocabulary, and the very
simple device whereby this vocabulary
may be made to express all ideas clearly.</p>

<p class='c015'>To take again the word “death” as an
example: the key-word is “mort” (which
we have in the English mortal). Remembering
that in Esperanto all nouns end in
“o,” all adjectives in “a,” adverbs in
“e,” infinitives in “i”; that contraries are
formed by prefixing “mal”; that the prefix
“sen” means without; that the suffix
“ant” marks the agent (corresponding to
the English “ing”), and that the suffix
“ig” means to cause, we get from the
above root: morto, death; morta, mortal;
morti, to die; morte, mortally; mortano,
the dying man; mortanta, dying; mortigi,
to cause death, or kill; mortigo, murder;
mortiganto, murderer; mortiga, death-dealing;
malmorta, living; senmorta,
Immortal; senmorto, immortality, etc.</p>

<p class='c015'>The conjugation of verbs, which is the
great stumbling-block in the study of all
natural languages, presents no difficulty
whatever in Esperanto. In the first
place, there are no irregular verbs; secondly,
there is only one ending for each
tense; thirdly, the number of tenses is
reduced to a strict minimum, mainly
past, present, future, and conditionally.</p>

<p class='c015'>The infinitive of all verbs ends in “t”;
the present always in “as”; the past
always in “is”; the conditional always
in “us”; these endings are the same in
the singular and the plural.</p>

<p class='c015'>To sum up, Esperanto is the easiest of
all languages; all that is needed to read
and write it is a familiarity with the few
grammatical principles, most of which
have been explained above, a knowledge
of the thirty-odd suffixes and the half-dozen
prefixes alluded to, and a dictionary
giving the two thousand roots, many
of which most of us know already.</p>

<p class='c015'>Any one with the merest smattering of
Latin and German and a knowledge of
English can write a letter in Esperanto
practically from the start; in fact, a person
with a knack for languages can do
so without this previous knowledge if
provided with a dictionary.</p>

<p class='c015'>As for speaking it, that is, of course, a
matter of practise. It is easy enough, yet
practise for a couple of months is indispensable
to become fluent. Those interested
should form a club and meet for
the purpose of conversing. The pronunciation
is as easy as the rest of the language.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is this artificial language to come into
real use? Professor Borgerhoff shows
us that it is at least spreading rapidly.
In June, 1905, there was only a handful
of Esperantists in America. One year
later there were fifty clubs, mostly in colleges.
Paris offers about twenty free
public courses. All over Europe the
language has hundreds of thousands of
adherents. Three thousand Esperantists,
representing fifteen different countries,
attended the congress at Boulogne-sur-Mer,
in August, 1905.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE CASH COST OF CONVERTING A SOUL.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Mormons Figure That It Amounts to $1,500, While Volunteers of America Find That $5 Will Do.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Mormons appear to spend more
money to secure a single convert
than any other sect. Elder Ellsworth,
of the Chicago Mormon Mission,
told the Chicago <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite> that his
church expended probably fifteen hundred
dollars for each convert. The
statement came out in connection with
the <cite>Inter-Ocean’s</cite> inquiry into the cash
cost of saving souls in Chicago. The
Mormon figures were highest; the figures
of the Volunteers of America—five dollars
a convert—were lowest. It is
patent that the average cost of conversion
is much higher to-day than it used
to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rev. George Soltau, a well-known
evangelist, at work in Chicago,
said to the <cite>Inter-Ocean’s</cite> representative:</p>

<p class='c014'>Twenty-two years ago the cost of soul-saving
was infinitesimal. A picture of
heaven, a few passages from the Scripture,
a prayer, and a request were sufficient—a
few cents, in fact, and our task
was accomplished. To-day people have
no leisure. They have no time to listen
to what preachers have to say. They
read cheap literature, which, as a rule, is
antagonistic to evangelization.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Present Facts in a Commercial Way.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Religious phraseology doesn’t work.
We have to present our facts in a commercial
way. We don’t relish it, but we
have to move with the times. We content
ourselves with the fact that, after all,
true religion is transacting business with
God and with heaven.</p>

<p class='c015'>General education has made it much
more difficult to convert the people and
to conduct a campaign of evangelization.
The people are provided with so many
methods of occupying their time and
thought that there is no longer any possibility
of getting individuals to come to
a church to fill in a spare hour as they
used to do so readily.</p>

<p class='c015'>This fact has been demonstrated to me
again and again, and forced home when I
find myself in places where I used to
hold meetings with five or six hundred
people in attendance and where now I
find difficulty in getting together an audience
of twenty or thirty people.</p>

<p class='c015'>A minister of to-day is also familiar
with the fact that the Bible no longer
occupies the place of authority in the
minds of the people that it used to. And
when a preacher has to prove the truth
of his only authority it is a bad tendency
on the part of the people.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is the same as if a lawyer, when he
appeared in court to plead his case, were
obliged to prove the truth of the Constitution,
which is the fundamental law. On
the other hand, the evangelist himself
hasn’t the slightest doubt of the authority
of his message, while he knows his hearers
have.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Education and Evangelism.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Asked whether, in his opinion, the education
which had proved detrimental to
evangelism was a bad thing for the people
themselves, Mr. Soltau replied:</p>

<p class='c014'>It is both good and bad. It is good
in that it develops the minds and gives
the people something to think about, and
it is bad in that it diminishes their fear
and reverence for the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c015'>Culture has undermined faith largely.
It has destroyed the foundations on
which faith used to rest; not that the
foundations are one whit injured, but the
building of character has been shifted
to other foundations, namely, those of
human opinion, research, discovery, and
creed untested by what was supposed to
be divine revelation.</p>

<p class='c015'>Modern thought has infected universally
the people with doubt upon all that
was supposed to be established fact. And
it has given nothing in its place except
speculation and private opinion, so that
every man is practically his own God to
do and think as he chooses.</p>

<p class='c015'>The production of literature—scientific,
historical, and fictional—is so enormous
as to demand the spare time of every one
to read it. The pulpit and the pew, the
magazine reader and the newspaper reader,
have been infected with the German
rationalism and philosophy, which has
dared to assert itself as of higher authority
than the Scriptures.</p>

<p class='c015'>Authority has been destroyed, there is
no court of appeal above human reason.
That being so, there is nothing to correct
human reason and bring it back to its
old bearings. We have to evangelize people
who have little or no substratum of
Bible knowledge, and have no cultivated
faith in any one but themselves.</p>

<p class='c015'>The enormous wealth and rapid development
of the material resources of the
country have opened up innumerable
outlets for the energies of mind and body,
and the possibilities of getting rich have
absorbed every one almost, so that the
dollar has first and last place in the people’s
minds. It is almost impossible to
dislodge it. The altered conditions of
civilization have destroyed simplicity of
living and of thinking, hence there is no
room or time for spiritual things.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>The Average Churchgoer.</h4>

<p class='c017'>The low level of spirituality attained by
the average church member disgusts the
man of the world, who sees no distinct
advantage in religion beyond possibly a
social one. The average Christian thinks
only of his personal safety and has no
concern for his neighbor. His is mainly a
selfish religion, and such poor samples
are abroad of what God is supposed to do
that the successful business man, who
knows how he feels about results, discounts
such enormously, and looks upon
the whole thing as beneath his notice.</p>

<p class='c015'>Democracy has produced lawlessness
enormously. It begins in the family,
where parental control is at a big discount.
The grown boy gets his way at
any cost to others’ business.</p>

<p class='c015'>He has learned to ignore law and authority
from the beginning. The laws of
the community are evaded, then the laws
of the State, then of the Federal government.
He believes he is a law unto himself.
There is no law of God to need his
attention. There is no God to trouble
about. The book of God is never read.
The day of God is utterly ignored. The
future life does not concern him, so he
needs no Gospel, no mission, no Saviour,
no prayer, and the whole thing is gone.</p>

<p class='c015'>The dollar values everything. How
much happiness, how much pleasure, how
much for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Soltau, however, does not think
that the Bible has lost its power. None
of the modern intellectual and worldly
developments satisfy the secret cravings
of the soul.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>EDUCATION PRESCRIBED AS ANTIDOTE FOR WAR.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>President Faunce Believes the Spirit of Perpetual Peace Is Lurking in Public Schools.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Since the majority of evils spring
from ignorance, education is the
surest safeguard of virtue. It is a
strong perversity that continues against
a real understanding of the truth.</p>

<p class='c013'>If war is an evil—moral, economic—as
both economists and moralists generally
admit, the hope of universal peace
rests upon education. For that reason
the suggestions made by President H. P.
Faunce, of Brown University, in a
speech at New Haven, carry the greater
weight. He said:</p>

<p class='c014'>No great movement is permanent until
placed on an educational basis. Whatever
enters the public mind through the
schools enters as sunshine and rain into
the fiber of the oak. A world-wide movement
is now in progress, having as its
object not the reformation of human nature,
not the disbanding of all armies and
navies, but simply the establishment of
a better means than war for the settling
of the disputes that must occur as long
as the nations endure.</p>

<p class='c015'>Already great results have been accomplished.
Arbitration has been substituted
for war in the majority of the cases. War
is now the exception, not the rule, in case
of international quarrel. It is not true
that “in time of peace we must prepare
for war,” but rather that in time of peace,
we must prepare to make war impossible.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is a growing appreciation
throughout the world of the irrationality
and futility of war. We have come to
realize that the simultaneous discharge
of pistols at fifty paces is no more likely
to establish justice than the tossing of
pennies or the throwing of the dice.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the duelist became absurd, dueling
was dead. The time is surely coming
when the international duel will seem, in
the face of international opinion, an utterly
stupid way of settling differences.</p>

<p class='c015'>What can we do in the public schools?
We can inculcate the broad principle that
rational men, when they differ, should appeal
to reason and not to force. Already
our schoolboys do this in athletics. They
are accustomed to accept the decisions of
umpires and referees without whining or
complaint. The athletic field is a direct
training for arbitration on a large scale.</p>

<p class='c015'>We can teach in our schools that peace
hath her victories no less renowned than
war. We are learning to exalt a new
type of heroism—the heroism of the social
settlement of the city missionary, of
the men and women who are devoting
their lives to the uplifting of social conditions
in the heart of our great cities.
This newer heroism must be taught in
our public schools.</p>

<p class='c015'>We can inculcate the brotherhood of
man in every class in our schools, and in
every study that is taught. We can show
that racial antagonisms are baseless and
brutal. Each of the various races makes
its own contribution to modern civilization.
The last address of John Hay was
an appeal for this point of view; for
earnest endeavor on the part of all men
and women in responsible positions to
inculcate the method of arbitration as a
substitute for the utilities of war.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>GERMANY’S FIGHT FOR COMMERCIAL SUPREMACY.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Study of Other Nations’ Needs and Mastery of Their Languages Give Her Advantages.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>If the rise of the United States to a
position of first importance has been
the great phenomenon of the last
decade, the tremendous strides made by
Germany in commerce and industry
should be placed only second in importance.
The reasons in the one case cannot
be the reasons in the second; whence
the value of a descriptive analysis of the
German advance, such as the article by
Dr. Louis Elkino, which appeared in a
recent number of the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>.
He writes:</p>

<p class='c014'>If I were asked to say what has contributed
most to Germany’s progress, I
should unhesitatingly mention the development
of patriotism in its best sense in
the individual, and, though this historic
fact cannot be proved by the usual methods
of the statisticians, we know beyond
doubt that the nation has come to work
together as a firm and united organization.</p>

<p class='c007'>His conclusions on the importance of
education were:</p>

<p class='c014'>There can no longer be any doubt that
Germany’s industrial advance is mainly
due to the extent and thoroughness with
which technical education is being conducted.
Briefly stated, the secret of the
pronounced success of the technical colleges
in the Fatherland lies in the fact
that they have kept pace with the ever-increasing
scope of all branches of
science in general, and, to the same extent,
with the ever-increasing demands
of the present-day industrial enterprises
upon scientific investigation and research.</p>

<p class='c015'>And, in addition, the number of subjects
and sciences taught is constantly
being added to, while, on the other hand,
the harmonious blending of the practical
with the theoretical has greatly furthered
the development of the scientific spirit
in all its essential details.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important cause is the great
pains taken to master foreign languages.</p>

<p class='c014'>German firms are competing strongly
with British firms in markets which,
at one time, were almost entirely in the
hands of British merchants, and this is
not surprising, for the British representative,
as a rule, has little or no knowledge
of the language of the country in which
he travels for orders, while the German
is able to speak it fluently. It is extraordinary
that British firms should continue
to send abroad representatives who can
speak no other language but their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Efficiency of method is not the least
of the main contributory factors.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is thoroughness which, perhaps more
than anything else, Germans have to
thank for their present happy state of
abounding prosperity. It has enabled
Germany to overcome one crisis after another
in commerce and finance, inasmuch
as it helps to the discovery of where the
weakness lies. Economists teach that
small concerns cannot exist side by side
with large ones when they are in competition,
but this is disproved in the world
of German enterprise. The small firms
flourish almost equally with the large
ones; like the great trusts, they are able,
when they wish, to sell cheaply in foreign
markets. Both employ the same
methods. This partly explains how it is
that, though there has been a concentration
of wealth and of enterprise into the
hands of a limited number of people,
a vast amount of money has been distributed
more or less evenly into the
hands of the population of the country as
a whole.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>“AMERICANS PERFECT CHILDREN IN BUSINESS.”</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Bernard Shaw Says Our Stratum of Romanticism Prevents Us from Knowing the Real Thing.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>George Bernard Shaw is
never afraid to express an opinion
on any subject, and apparently
he is never at a loss for the opinion.
The other day he expressed his views on
business, saying:</p>

<p class='c014'>The most striking peculiarity about
business men is that I have never met
one who understands the slightest thing
about business.</p>

<p class='c015'>Business men have certain set, conventional
methods. Propose to them a way
of doing business that departs from their
usual method, and although the new way
may mean more profit, they will not accept
it unless forced to, and even then
they believe they are being swindled.</p>

<p class='c015'>My own way of doing business is perhaps
novel, but it is neither harsh nor
unfair. But it is novel, and therefore the
men I deal with object to it, although
they themselves are the gainers by doing
things my way and not the way in which
they are used. Yet they regard me with
suspicion. It is very much as if you
offered a man five dollars for doing something
for which he had previously been
in the habit of receiving a dollar, and having
him denounce you as a swindler.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not content with generalities, Mr.
Shaw went on to discuss Englishmen and
Americans as business men.</p>

<p class='c014'>In making an agreement with an
Englishman, you may be sure of one
thing: if it is not entirely to his advantage
he will not keep it.</p>

<p class='c015'>An Englishman, when he wants a
house, or money, or anything else, knows
that in order to get what he wants he
has to sign something. He does not care
what he signs as long as he gets what he
wants. After he obtains the money or
the house, or whatever else he stood in
need of, if he finds the agreement he
signed disagreeable, he will denounce
the man who holds it as a knave or a
scoundrel and as one who is trying to
take unfair advantage of him.</p>

<p class='c015'>In my own experience with Englishmen,
the terms of my agreements, satisfactory
at the time of signing, have
afterward proved irksome. They would
then come to me and say: “Surely, Mr.
Shaw, you cannot expect to hold us to
such outrageous terms”; and when I
would point to the agreements bearing
their signature, they would retort:
“Surely, Mr. Shaw, you are a gentleman!”</p>

<p class='c015'>After all, the Jew is the only man who
knows what he is signing, and will keep
absolutely to his agreement.</p>

<p class='c015'>Americans are perfect children In business.
They have a stratum of romanticism
that prevents them from knowing
what business really is. This childish,
romantic spirit impels them to be doing
things, to cut somebody out, to do something
that nobody else has done, or to
do a greater thing than anybody else has
ever done. Accidents, of course, will happen,
and sometimes they make money.
But the percentage of failures in America
is something terrible. We never hear of
these. Every attention is centered on the
conspicuous few who have made success.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>QUEEN MARGHERITA ON THE SPHERE OF WOMAN.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>She Abhors “Race Suicide,” and Condemns the So-Called “Emancipation” of Her Sex.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The Dowager Queen Margherita of
Italy has been expressing her disapproval
of “race suicide” with
no less frankness than President Roosevelt.
Not often is a queen interviewed;
less often is a royal interview more than
a collection of perfunctory phrases, polite,
but insignificant. Yet Queen Margherita
has been saying:</p>

<p class='c014'>A childless family is incomplete. There
is a poetry and a pathos about childhood
which appeal to every right-hearted woman.
Most women, though they may not
be able to put this idea into words, feel it.
They have the maternal instinct. Hence
the remoteness of race suicide.</p>

<p class='c015'>Women show their intellectuality by
rearing healthy and great children, just
as much as they do by writing books or
painting pictures. The wife who deliberately
refuses to bring children into the
world must have something wrong with
her moral make-up.</p>

<p class='c015'>I am very pleased to know that there
is a movement in the United States in
favor of large families, and that President
Roosevelt has put himself upon record
as favoring them. European women
have begun to look for light to their
sisters of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the subject of woman’s “emancipation”
Queen Margherita is equally
outspoken:</p>

<p class='c014'>I am absolutely opposed to any extravagant
theories of what is called the
emancipation of women. In whatever
condition of life a woman may be placed,
her first duty is the negative one of not
giving up the qualities that distinguish
her sex. Above all, she should guard
against developing the trait of men. A
blending of ancient reserve with modern
independence would give us the ideal
woman.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BIG BURDEN OF DEBT CARRIED BY BOSTONIANS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Statistics Show That Ten Per Cent of Them Owe for Food, Rent, Clothing, and Funeral Expenses.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Charles F. Pidgin, chief of the
Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics
of Labor, has been inquiring
into the question of debt. Statistics issued
by the Bureau show that at least
ten per cent of the residents of Boston
are in debt for their food, rent, clothing,
furniture, and for funeral and other
expenses. These people are thus partly
supported by others. Mr. Pidgin
says:</p>

<p class='c014'>Debt has gained such a hold upon the
people of to-day that the only sure way
to decrease the number of people who
owe money, not only for extravagances
but for sustenance, seems to be to begin
with the children, and devise some
scheme by which thrift may be taught in
the public schools. The generation which
is growing up should be taught to have
a horror of indebtedness, and how to
earn money, how to save it, and how to
spend it wisely.</p>

<p class='c015'>The effect of intemperance is taught in
the public schools. Why should there not
be some sort of course of study that will
show the effect of indebtedness on a person’s
life and character?</p>

<p class='c015'>The children nowadays do not, as a
rule, know the value of money. When
they want spending money they go to
their parents and ask for it. When it is
gone they ask for more. Neither the
parents nor the children in most cases
know how much money goes in this way,
and the youngsters are not called upon
to exercise judgment in spending the
money.</p>

<p class='c015'>The little newsboys on the street work
hard for their money. They know the
value of every cent, and that they must
save for a rainy day.</p>

<p class='c015'>If other children were taught to earn a
little, instead of having it always given to
them, they would make better citizens
and would know how far a dollar should
go.</p>

<p class='c015'>If parents who give their children
money when they ask for it would, instead,
give them a stated sum each week
or month for spending money, and make
it an object for them to save it, it would
go a long way toward prejudicing them
against debt.</p>

<p class='c015'>I believe in allowances for children, and
for wives, too, for that matter. It makes
them responsible for a certain sum, and
nearly always they will take a certain
pride in making it go as far as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chief Watts, of the Boston police,
does not think that debt is a cause of
crime. He says:</p>

<p class='c014'>I never heard of any one stealing to
pay their debts, and although being in
debt may have an influence on a certain
class of criminals—such as shoplifters
and embezzlers—I do not think that it
has any influence on the general run of
crime.</p>

<p class='c015'>So far as suicide and murders are concerned,
I can’t recall a case of suicide
where the person had been worrying
about debt, neither can I recall a murder
that debt had anything to do with.</p>

<p class='c015'>It’s girls, not debt, that cause murders
and suicides—not that I blame the women;
I should not want to be understood
that way—but love-affairs are generally
the cause of police records along those
lines. Men seldom get desperate from
debt. I believe that the general tendency
of every one is to pay his debts if he has
half a chance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a Massachusetts sage—Emerson—who
wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Wilt thou seal up the avenues of ill?</div>

<h3 class='c016'>WANTS RIFLE-SHOOTING MADE NATIONAL SPORT.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Lord Roberts Believes Patriotism Should Cause It to Take Its Place With Golf and Cricket.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Lord Roberts has been pleading
for the instruction of all able-bodied
citizens of England in
rifle-shooting. He says, in the London
<cite>Express</cite>:</p>

<p class='c014'>The rifle is our national weapon of to-day,
but unhappily neither law nor custom
enjoins that the manhood of our
country should learn its use. Cricket
and football are our national pastimes;
why should we not make rifle-shooting
another?</p>

<p class='c015'>Rifle-shooting is a sport—a game attractive
enough in itself; and every
marksman should bear in mind that in
learning how to shoot he is fitting himself
as a member of a great empire to
take up arms for the defense of his country.
Rifle-shooting should be at once a
national pastime and a patriotic duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reasons for this suggestion are not
few. “Bobs” proceeds to make the
most of his case, for he goes on to say:</p>

<p class='c014'>The American authorities, in the recently
published rules for the “promotion
of rifle practise,” gave it as their opinion
that, “in estimating the military efficiency
of a soldier, if we consider ten
points as a standard of perfection, at
least eight of these points are skill in
rifle shooting,” and with that opinion I
quite agree.</p>

<p class='c015'>If, then, the scheme which I have been
strenuously advocating for some time
past is carried to a successful conclusion,
we shall be a nation whose manhood
will be for practical purposes all efficient
soldiers—an efficiency, moreover, that
can be obtained without the least interference
with industrial or professional
pursuits.</p>

<p class='c015'>But for the whole scheme to be successful,
it is desirable that boys, youths,
and men should be given a certain
amount of military training and instruction
in the use of the rifle.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is, I am aware, urged against my proposals
that they are little short of conscription.
I have frequently asserted before
that I am altogether opposed to
conscription as being totally inapplicable
to an army the greater part of which
must always be serving abroad.</p>

<p class='c015'>Surely there is all the difference in the
world between a nation, every man of
which is obliged to serve in the ranks of
the regular army and perform while in
those ranks all the onerous duties of a
regular soldier during times of peace and
for small wars, as is the case on the
Continent, and a nation which, while
maintaining a regular army for foreign
service, asks every man to undergo such
a training as will fit him to take a useful
part in a great national emergency when
every true Briton would be, in point of
fact, certain to volunteer, and only the
shirkers, the unpatriotic, and the disloyal
would be content to remain passive.</p>

<p class='c015'>The people of this country should identify
themselves with the army and take
an intelligent interest in what the army
has to do, and not regard it as something
quite outside the national life; and this
they would certainly do if military training
became universal and rifle shooting
a national pursuit.</p>

<p class='c015'>We need not be afraid that such training
and a generally acquired efficiency
with the rifle would result in a spirit of
militarism that would make us anxious
for war. I believe, and would I could
persuade haters of militarism to believe,
that there is no surer guarantee of
peace than to be prepared for war; and
if every able-bodied man is prepared to
play the part of the strong man armed,
his own and his country’s goods will remain
at peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who cry out for greater military
efficiency and those who argue that
less attention should be given to the
things of war are seeking by opposite
means the same result—the abolishment
for all time of “that mad game the
world so loves to play.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>RELATIONS OF A MAN’S STATURE AND GENIUS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Evidence Produced to Disprove Napoleon’s Theory That Short Men Are the More Intellectual.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>What is the height of genius?
How do its physical inches correspond
with its altitude of mind
and soul? These questions are a subject
of curious inquiry with the Boston
<cite>Herald</cite>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Napoleon the Great, a short man, surrounded
himself with a staff of short
men. He did not care to look like a
pygmy among his subordinates. Doubtless
vanity contributed to his preference
for few inches. He said of General
Kléber: “He has all the qualities and
defects of a tall man.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Napoleon would not only have agreed
with Lombroso that great men are short
men, but he went further than that; he
altered the stature of Frederick the
great, of Alexander, of Cæsar, to suit
himself. He always insisted that they
were short men, but the chroniclers of
their times tell us otherwise.</p>

<p class='c015'>The chroniclers of Napoleon’s time
seem to have been struck by his own
fancy, for they made him as short as they
conveniently could. His old friend Bourrienne
wrote Napoleon’s height as five
feet two inches. Constant put it at five
feet one inch. But, after all, these were
old French measures.</p>

<p class='c015'>Captain Maitland’s testimony is more
to the point. It was to Captain Maitland
that Napoleon surrendered on board the
Bellerophon. Maitland measured him
and recorded the fallen conqueror’s
height as five feet seven inches, English.
That, by the way, is half an inch more
than the stature of Lord Roberts.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>The Test of Figures.</h4>

<p class='c017'>But the Napoleonic theory does not
bear the test of figures. Intellectual
power in its varied manifestations is not
found at its utmost strength in small men
only. It takes men as it finds them—tall
and short, thin and plump—and it
seems to rather like height.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thackeray was six feet four inches. So
was Fielding. Scott, Walt Whitman, and
Tennyson were six-footers. Goethe, the elder
Dumas, Robert Burns, and Longfellow
were five feet ten inches. J. M. Barrie
is only five feet five inches, and Kipling
only five feet six inches. Edwin A. Abbey
has the same height as Barrie; so
has Alma-Tadema.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lord Curzon is six feet one inch,
George Westinghouse is over six feet two
inches, Andrew Carnegie is five feet four
and a half inches, President Roosevelt is
five feet nine inches. Mr. Gladstone was
five feet nine inches. Sir Henry Irving
was an inch taller.</p>

<p class='c015'>Edmund Burke and Oliver Cromwell
were five feet ten and a half inches,
which, by the way, is the height of the
present Prime Minister of England, Sir
Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Wellington
was half an inch taller than Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c015'>That trio of great admirals—Nelson,
Blake, and Sydney Smith—were a little
under five feet six inches. Bismarck was
a tall man, but not so tall as George
Washington, who was six feet three
inches. Sargent, the great painter, is six
feet; Carlyle, Darwin, Huxley, and Ruskin
were six-footers.</p>

<p class='c015'>Disraeli and Dickens were five feet
nine inches, which is also the stature of
Sir William Crookes. Sir Oliver Lodge
is six feet three inches, Marconi five feet
ten and a half inches.</p>

<p class='c015'>Emerson, Hans Andersen, Wordsworth,
Bunyan, Audubon, Corot, Moltke, Millet,
Gounod, Lord Clive, and Lord Brougham
were tall men. So were Humboldt and
Helmholtz. Lord Kelvin is five feet seven
inches, Lord Reay six feet two inches.
Conan Doyle is six feet one inch, Anthony
Hope three inches shorter. All these figures
give the stature of the men in their
boots.</p>

<p class='c015'>King Edward is five feet eight and a
half inches, the Kaiser just an inch shorter.
The Mikado is five feet six inches,
the King of Italy five feet two inches.
The Czar’s height is the same as the
Kaiser’s. Leopold, King of the Belgians,
is six feet five inches.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Americans Taller Than Englishmen.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Peter the Great was six feet eight and
a half Inches. Abraham Lincoln was
just under six feet two inches, Sir Walter
Raleigh and Sir Richard Burton six feet.
Alfred de Musset, Froude, Puvis de Chavannes,
Poussin, Lessing. Schiller, Lamartine,
and Sterne were tall men. W. S.
Gilbert is over six feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>It would be possible to lengthen this
list to the point of tediousness. But the
more the subject is examined, the farther
away we get from the Napoleonic
theory. Nature has a pretty wide range
in these matters, and she makes the most
of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>When it comes to averages, figures
prepared by the anthropometric committee
of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science indicate that the
average stature of the male adults of
England is five feet seven inches and
seven-eighths, although the professional
and commercial classes show “a mean
height of from two to three inches above
this, and the laboring classes an inch or
two below.” The Scotch and Irish are a
little taller, and the Welsh a little shorter
than the English.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average for the United States is
said to be taller than the English—a
fact which implies neither genius nor
the lack of it.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>AMERICAN TRADITIONS AND THE ICONOCLASTS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Persons Who Hew Too Close to the Line of History Get Little Thanks for Their Pains.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Iconoclasts have been busy with
American history for a good many
years. They have cut the props
from under more than one valued tradition.
In the interest of literal fact they
have destroyed much that is imaginatively
valuable. Too often the one can
be gained only by loss of the other, and
it is not easy to decide which vantages
most. At least there is some ground
for nourishing tradition.</p>

<p class='c013'>H. J. Haskell praised the “researchers”
in a recent article in the <cite>Independent</cite>.
The Chicago <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite> makes
reply, saying:</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Haskell cites as a correction of
“important errors in the viewpoint”
“the proof that the Revolution was not
the result of conscious tyranny and oppression
on the part of the British Government.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, who now cares whether it was or
was not? What difference does it make
either way in the relations of the American
and British peoples and their governments?
Those relations are determined
by present interests and future
hopes.</p>

<p class='c015'>We know our forefathers were right,
and we do not care whether their opponents
were right from their own viewpoint
or not. Englishmen who count
know that their forefathers blundered
egregiously, and do not care whether
they were conscientious or not in their
folly.</p>

<p class='c015'>It may be true—it probably is—that
Weems fabricated outright the cherry-tree
story about George Washington. But
what difference does that make? The
story simply imputed to Washington the
boy the known character of Washington
the man. It hurt no one, and it has inspired
millions of American boys, by
setting before them the example of a man
whose greatness and goodness none could
question, to be true rather than false,
even when it was hard to tell the truth.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>The “Rehabilitation” of Burr.</h4>

<p class='c017'>A great deal is said about the “rehabilitation”
of Aaron Burr. But what
is the effect of it all? To show that Burr
was not technically a traitor? The courts
said so long ago, and, despite personal
opinions, the verdict was accepted as the
law in practise. In trying doubly to
prove Burr no traitor, the rehabilitators
have proved him a blackmailing filibusterer—a
man who lacked the courage to
conquer a State, but sought to steal one—a
man whose ambition and effort it was
to play the part of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,</div>
      <div class='line'>That from a shelf the precious diadem stole.</div>
      <div class='line'>And put it in his pocket!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>A great deal is also said of the evidence
from his own diary of the “hollowness”
and the “double dealing” of
President Polk in his conduct toward
Mexico. What is really proved by this
evidence is that James K. Polk was not
a cheap opportunist, waiting to be forced
to act by situations created by others,
but foresaw those situations and was
ready to take advantage of them for the
expansion of his country and the increase
of its power.</p>

<p class='c015'>To discover that James K. Polk was
never taken by surprise, and that all his
great political acts were purposed and
planned for long in advance, does not
degrade him, but exalts his character by
proving its conscious strength. It lifts
James K. Polk out of the Gladstone class
and puts him at least on the borders of
the Bismarck class of statesmanship.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Game Not Worth the Candle.</h4>

<p class='c017'>And of what earthly or heavenly importance
is it to any human soul to know
that the Pilgrims did not actually land in
a body on Plymouth Rock on a certain
day? Or that the old stone tower at
Newport is not what Longfellow suggested,
a relic of the Northmen, but merely
Governor Arnold’s windmill?</p>

<p class='c015'>Or that the Spanish settlers in America
treated the Indians, on the whole, more
humanely than did the English? Or that,
if the Americans’ powder had not run out
and they had been able to hold Bunker
Hill, they would probably have been captured
the next day?</p>

<p class='c015'>With all their labor and kicking up of
dust, and the personal notoriety they get
by it, the “researchers” whom Mr. Haskell
praises have not changed the main
and abiding conceptions of our history
at all. Their game seems hardly worth
the candles consumed at it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Truth is the first aim of the historian.
History has been characterized as a pack
of lies, generally agreed to by its
makers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Anything but history,” said Horace
Walpole, “for history must be false.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The business of the scientific historian
is to examine all witnesses, hear all the
evidences, and get at the exact facts,
even though they make ancient reputations
tumble.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet we cannot but ask with
Wordsworth:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Those old credulities, to nature dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall they no longer bloom upon the stock</div>
      <div class='line'>Of History?</div>

<h3 class='c016'>TIME IS RIPE FOR SALOON’S SUBSTITUTE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>After Three Months’ Abstinence, San Francisco Finds That It Has Lost Its Old-Time Thirst.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>San Francisco, after its terrific
shake-up, dropped the liquor business
temporarily. The man in
control foresaw the dangers of alcohol
to a homeless community.</p>

<p class='c013'>After three months saloons were permitted
to open. What was the effect?
A simultaneous rush for the swinging
doors? Not at all. People seemed to
have got out of the way of drinking;
and this was true in spite of the fact
that, during the period of “enforced abstinence,”
they could always get liquor
from outside the city limits, if they
wanted it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The San Francisco <cite>Chronicle</cite> says:</p>

<p class='c014'>Liquor drinking is with most people not
the gratification of an appetite, but a
mere habit. There is no liquor and few
wines which taste good. Even the toper
who takes his whisky straight washes
the taste out of his mouth with water as
quickly as he can.</p>

<p class='c015'>With a comparatively few there is a
real craving for liquor, or at least for its
stimulating effects, but the vast majority
of those who drink in saloons do so
merely because in the poverty of their intellects
they know no other way of manifesting
good fellowship toward friends
whom they meet. So the drink habit is
formed, which, in some cases, degenerates
into dissipation and the drunkard’s
craving.</p>

<p class='c015'>But even the classes which contain
most of our hard drinkers seem really
to care little for whisky, for they are
not resorting to the saloons in any such
number as was expected. Some seem to
have formed the buttermilk or some similar
habit, and have no inclination to return
to the saloon—doubtless greatly to
the happiness of their wives and the comfort
of their children.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Habit, Not Appetite.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Whether this will last we do not know.
Probably not. Mankind is gregarious,
and the only public roof under which
men may gather for the free enjoyment
of a pipe and a friendly chat is the roof
of the saloon. Therefore they will go to
the saloon, and keep going until society
tempts them away with something at
least equally attractive.</p>

<p class='c015'>They can go to the Young Men’s
Christian Association, but they don’t
want to. They will not be allowed to
light their pipes, put their feet on the
table, lean back in their chairs and blow
smoke-rings to the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c015'>Not even the public libraries do anything
to draw men from the saloons.
They must be “decorous,” take off their
hats, and be silent. They don’t want to.
Every public library should have a smoking-room
where ordinary conversation is
allowed. It will not disturb those who
are reading. If it does they can go to
other rooms.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fact that it is habit and not appetite
that is to be dealt with is the psychological
basis of the so-called Gothenberg
plan. On that plan all the saloons of a
city are conducted by a corporation,
whose members receive as dividends only
a fixed, moderate interest on the investment,
all profits above that going, in
some form, to the public. There is no
“bar.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>The Gothenberg Plan.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Customers sit at a table and their liquor
is served to them. All saloons must keep
“soft drinks” and give them at least as
much prominence as is given to strong
drinks. Under no circumstances is any
attendant to have any interest in the
sales of liquor, although in some cases
he is allowed a commission on soft
drinks and other refreshments.</p>

<p class='c015'>No one is permitted to get intoxicated
on the premises. There is no attempt to
compel men to abstain. There is a continual
temptation to do so. The army
canteen was based on this theory, and
was a most useful institution until some
misguided women abolished it and drove
the soldiers to debauchery. Nothing else
was to be expected, or was expected, by
the experienced.</p>

<p class='c015'>The experience of this city proves that
the drink habit is not difficult to overcome—not,
however, by coercion, but by
temptation. And men cannot be tempted
to any extent by any efforts which have
the missionary or altruistic flavor. Men
wish to assemble in public places where
there is entire freedom as to dress and
appearance, and where there is no danger
that anybody will solicit them to become
better men. They are not only
willing, but desire, to spend something
for the “good of the house” and their
own entertainment.</p>

<p class='c015'>If society will provide them with such
a place a good many will go there in preference
to a saloon. If, at the same time,
all saloons are abolished, they will speedily
content themselves with such substitutes
as we have suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>All of which would seem to support
the theory that the saloon is “the poor
man’s club.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>HOW LAW APPRAISES THE LIFE OF A MAN.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Legal Decisions Indicate That His Cash Value Begins to Deteriorate When He Is Twenty-Five.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>What is the value of a man?
What is his average physical
value, measured in dollars and
cents? We hear it said that in partly
civilized countries human life is cheap.
We are told that the great movements
typified by the American and French
revolutions have raised the value of the
individual. Can we get these comparisons
into an arithmetical table?</p>

<p class='c013'>Summarizing the statements of another
journal, the Saint Louis <cite>Globe-Democrat</cite>
says:</p>

<p class='c014'>After looking over legal decisions in
the various States, <cite>Bench and Bar</cite>, a publication
devoted to affairs of the law,
estimates that at ten years of age a boy
of the laboring class is worth two thousand
and sixty-one dollars and forty-two
cents; at fifteen, four thousand two hundred
and sixty-three dollars and forty-six
cents; at twenty-five, five thousand four
hundred and eighty-eight dollars and
three cents; from which time the decline
is steady, a man of seventy, by this legal
decision scale, rating at only seventeen
dollars and thirteen cents.</p>

<p class='c015'>By the same practical method of computation,
one eye is worth five thousand
dollars; one leg, fifteen thousand dollars;
two legs, twenty-five thousand dollars;
one arm, ten thousand dollars; one hand,
six thousand dollars; one finger, one
thousand five hundred dollars; and permanent
disability, twenty-five thousand
dollars. This is merely an average as far
as decisions have been examined.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of the candidates on the Democratic
State ticket, who was crippled for life
while an employee on a Missouri railroad,
fought his case through the courts for
nearly ten years, gained it several times,
but finally received nothing. So practise
varies as well as theory.</p>

<p class='c007'>The estimates of the value of a man’s
life are based upon an idea not of his
value to himself, but of his value to others.
The figures in individual cases
would vary greatly with reference to
whether or not the person’s death caused
hardship to others who had been dependent
on him. The value of a man to
himself is unimportant after he is dead.
His value to society at large cannot be
considered in a cash estimate, since that
kind of value often depends upon other
than physical resources. His value to
those who look to him for support can
alone be estimated on the material side.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>DOES HATE INCREASE EFFICIENCY OF ARMIES?</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Southern Newspaper Takes Issue With an English Naval Critic Who Avers That It Does.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>E. T. Jane, the English naval
critic, says the reason the Japanese
defeated the Russians was
that the Japanese hated the Russians
and longed to kill them, whereas the
Russian soldiers felt no consuming hatred
against their ant-like enemies. The
Columbia (South Carolina) <cite>State</cite> takes
issue with the theory, as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Jane is wrong, both as to his facts
and as to his theory. First as to his
facts:</p>

<p class='c015'>The Japanese did not hate the Russians.
They fought with tremendous fury
at times, but it was a calculated fury,
never a whirlwind of blind passion.
Never for a single moment in the long
struggle did they show such fury as to
lose sight of the essential principle of
modern warfare, complete self-protection.
Nor did they show any passion on the
field of battle, such as slaughtering
wounded men, or mutilating the dead;
yet the Russians were guilty of both
atrocities.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Russian prisoners were taken to
Japan they were treated with so much
consideration and kindness that they were
happier than they had been within their
own lines in Manchuria. Witness, again,
the magnanimous and truly magnificent
treatment accorded Stoessel and his garrison
and Rojestvensky and his captured
officers and men.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>The Bravest Are the Tenderest.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Not from the beginning to the close of
the war did the Japanese exhibit any
hatred of the Russians. They fought like
knights, like bushi—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The knightliest of the knightly race,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That since the days of old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have kept the lamp of chivalry</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Alight in hearts of gold.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>And considering Mr. Jane’s theory, that
hate makes a good fighter, it is as false
to-day as it was in the heyday of chivalry.
The poet is right in his view that “the
bravest are the tenderest, the loving are
the daring.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The old British idea, inherited from
the teachings of Nelson and his half-corsair
predecessors, that an Englishman
“should hate a Frenchman like the
devil,” is a sentiment that could well
have had its origin in the place to which
Nelson went for his sprightly imagery.</p>

<p class='c015'>The best fighters of the world to-day
are the men who can remain cool, unperturbed,
unblinded by passion in the
midst of battle. This is necessary in
order that they may see straight and
shoot straight; it is necessary in order
that they may be able to protect themselves
from the shot and shell of the
enemy.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Contrary to the Scientific Theory.</h4>

<p class='c017'>It is conceivable that a warrior of the
olden time might have been a bit more
effective when rushing furious with hate
into the ranks of his foe and laying about
him with short-sword, or falchion, or claymore;
although even in such case the
cool-headed warrior was generally able
to meet and overcome the raging brute.
To maintain that hate makes a good soldier
is to challenge the scientific theory
of warfare.</p>

<p class='c015'>Hate has never made a man more efficient
in any good cause, and in very few
bad ones. Browning says of Dante that
he “loved well because he hated,” but
Dante “hated wickedness that hinders
loving.” No mere hate adds anything to
a man’s efficiency. It saps his real
strength by misdirecting it and spending
it on the air in blind fury; it poisons
and corrodes the heart and mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>Chaucer says that “hate is old wrath”;
it is, therefore, a demoralizing and debasing
passion, weakening alike to body
and the mind. The recklessness it inspires
on the battle-field or in the daily
struggles of life is ineffective against the
coolness, deliberateness, and resourcefulness
of the passionless fighter.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>EARLY RISERS PUT ON THE DEFENSIVE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Philadelphia Writer Says Only the Lower Animals Go to Bed and Get Up With the Sun.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The delightful Elia, who is the
closest personal friend one may
find in all literature, exposed certain
fallacies once and for all to the
satisfaction of those who are whimsically
inclined. However, since not all
minds have the whimsical turn, the fallacies
continue to bob up from time to
time with a vitality that is suspiciously
Antæan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Consider the proverb: “Early to bed
and early to rise, makes a man healthy,
wealthy, and wise.” Any schoolboy will
tell you that this is not so; and yet the
fallacious statement persists—parents
still preach it; aged money-makers explain
their success by it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Says the Philadelphia <cite>Public Ledger</cite>:</p>

<p class='c014'>The very early riser is usually an opinionated
individual, and it is likely that
his habit of early rising is his only claim
to distinction. More poetry has been
written about eventide than the dawn.
This is quite conclusive, for poets are
sensible folk and not much given to the
folly of early rising.</p>

<p class='c015'>Some good literary work has been done
in the early hours, but this is exceptional.
Sir Walter Scott, it is said, wrote the
most of his romances before breakfast;
but a multitude of authors have produced
immortal works by the light of the midnight
oil without smelling of it.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Wilson Denounced Them.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Early risers descant rapturously upon
the delicious freshness of the morning air
and other delights which it is reported
can be enjoyed about sunrise, against
which may be offset the loveliness of the
dying day, the deepening shadows of the
twilight, and the charm of moonlight.
The glories of the dawn rest in rumor
only to the most of us, and must be taken
on faith. The suffrages of the majority
are for the sunset, and the majority rules
in the Republic.</p>

<p class='c015'>John Wesley wrote an excellent sermon
on early rising. Doddridge took
pride in the fact that he was at work at
five in the morning; but the famous
Doctor Wilson (Christopher North)
scouted the whole brood of sunrise workers
in a lengthy essay, which is the comfort
and solace of all lazy and normal
people.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wilson refused to take it for granted
that early rising is a virtuous habit, or
that early risers are a particularly meritorious
set.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I object to both clauses of the bill,”
says the courageous dissenter. “Early
risers are generally milksop spoonies,
ninnies with broad, unmeaning faces and
groset eyes, cheeks odiously rosy, and
with great calves to their legs.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>One of Primitive Man’s Habits.</h4>

<p class='c017'>This indictment was written in Scotland.
Matters may not be quite so disgraceful
here. Wilson questioned the motives
of his fellow countrymen who sally
forth at an impossibly early hour, and
suggested that their ambition is merely
to get an omnivorous appetite for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let no knavish prig purse up his
mouth and erect his head when he meets
an acquaintance who goes to bed and
rises at a gentlemanly hour.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The lower orders of creation go to bed
and rise with the sun. Primitive man
probably had this vicious habit. Civilization
has gradually reduced the ranks
of early risers to the healthy and vigorous
persons who purvey ice and milk
with much clatter when they ought to be
abed. The length of human life is increasing,
and this is due to late rising.
There can be no doubt about it. The sun
rises hereabouts at this season [July] at
4:30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and few there be who have the
nerve to witness the phenomenon.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>MANUAL LABOR IS MAKING NEW CONVERTS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Men Who Have Won Their Way With Their Brains Now Give Their Hands a Chance.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Men of standing are more willing
to work with their hands than
they used to be. The new love
for outdoor life may be in part responsible;
as also the growing interest in art-craft,
and a steady reaction against the
“machine-made.” In any event manual
work has been acquiring new dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Saint Paul <cite>Dispatch</cite> says that
until within a few years we were so bent
on emphasizing the intellectual that the
manual had no honor.</p>

<p class='c014'>To a certain appreciable extent this is
changing. Men are interested to-day in
seeing how much they can do for themselves.
It is not alone that the art-craft
movement has been inaugurated. We
speak of a very much more intimate and
amateurish thing than that.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is that men are resuming the ax and
hammer for the little common duties.
They are making things for the house
instead of calling in the casual carpenter.
Younger men still in school are employing
their vacation with carpenter work.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is no longer quite so respectable to
spend a college long-vacation canvassing
for books. It is now entirely respectable
to offer one’s services to a carpenter and
be employed in some concrete service
which shall at the summer’s end have
a visible aspect.</p>

<p class='c015'>This is a genuine triumph, and will
work toward the accomplishment of that
balancing of functions which has been
much disturbed of late.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now that men have reformed, we wonder
if a similar development can be
expected of women. There has been the
drift in woman work away from the work
of the hand to that of the mind.</p>

<p class='c015'>School teaching has been a pervading
ambition, and housework has been an
evil from which only the most skilled
failed of escape. In essence, one is no
less worthy an employment than the
other; each has certain philanthropic
aspects which should appeal equally to
women. But one has been exalted and
the other debased because of the manual
work, the esteem of the work of the
hands.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is a slightly detectable drift
back toward manual labor, although
much less apparent than in men’s work.
But at least there has been discovered a
science of household economics, and concrete
exemplification of this science may
secure recognition.</p>

<p class='c015'>It will probably be long before women
of colleges during the summer vacations
may with impunity, social impunity, go
into the hotels or the private kitchens,
to work, as college men are going into
the carpenter shop.</p>

<p class='c015'>Why there should be this invidious
distinction we do not know, since, so far
as we can judge, it is quite as noble to
feed mankind as to provide shelter. But
the evolution will be worth watching and
assisting.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>A SHINING MODEL FOR PHILANTHROPISTS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Farsightedness of Stephen Girard Made His Bequests the Most Valuable in the Country.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The death of Russell Sage and the
problem of the distribution of his
millions were the subject of much
comment, some of which led naturally
to editorial reminiscence. The Saint
Louis <cite>Globe-Democrat</cite> reverts to the
case of Stephen Girard, who, proportionately
to the amount of his possessions,
was probably his country’s greatest
benefactor in the way of public
bequests.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Stephen Girard died in Philadelphia,
in 1831, he was easily the richest
man in the United States, the estate he
disposed of amounting to seven million
dollars. By will, he gave one hundred
and forty thousand dollars to relatives
(he was a childless widower), a number
of bequests to employees, ninety-six
thousand dollars to organized charities,
three hundred thousand dollars to the
State of Pennsylvania for internal improvements,
and certain property in
Louisiana to the city of New Orleans for
public improvements.</p>

<p class='c015'>The residue, amounting to over six million
dollars, was bestowed on the city of
Philadelphia, chiefly for the erection and
maintenance of a college to accommodate
not fewer than three hundred white male
orphans, and the courts have construed
a fatherless boy to be an orphan.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Put City in Charge of Work.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Girard put the city in charge of
this work, and since 1869 it has been
managed by a board of trustees appointed
by the courts. Under its care the
value of the Girard estate has increased
to thirty-two million five hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, three-fourths of
which is productive real estate, with the
remainder in choice cash assets.</p>

<p class='c015'>Girard College, with its seventeen buildings,
occupies forty acres. Its pupils at
present number one thousand four hundred
and eighty-three, and up to the
present time it has fed, clothed, and educated
seven thousand seven hundred
boys, fitting them to step at once into
active pursuits. This work will go on
through the centuries with increasing resources.</p>

<p class='c015'>Girard had a striking version of what
wealth is for. He was a natural money-maker
from his first commercial venture.
He enjoyed the shaping of business and
making it pay. He was no easy mark,
but, giving others their due, exacted his
own. His public spirit was highly developed,
an inborn trait.</p>

<p class='c015'>As a banker in the period of the second
war with England, Girard personally
saved the credit of the national credit
more than once. He served Philadelphia
many years in various official capacities,
including that of councilman. Large internal
improvements appealed to him
strongly, and he was among the foremost
in advocating and subscribing to them.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Set No Value on Wealth.</h4>

<p class='c017'>Girard set no value upon wealth, except
as a means to accomplish worthy
ends, and these were more to him than
his money, or even his life.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the year 1793, when Philadelphia
lost a sixth of its population by yellow
fever, and most of its citizens had fled,
Girard personally took the inside management
of a pest-house, ignoring all other
business for two months. In one hundred
days of that autumn the burials
in the city exceeded four thousand.</p>

<p class='c015'>At forty years of age Girard had only
a competence, and wrote to a friend: “I
do not value fortune. The love of labor
is my highest ambition. I observe with
pleasure that you have a numerous family
and that you are in possession of an
honest fortune. This is all a wise man
has a right to wish for.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Yet in the next forty years, largely
through the fluctuations of values caused
by war, he honestly and usefully accumulated
seven million dollars, and devoted
it to an everlasting mission of beneficence
to his fellow men. He wrote
that “Labor is the price of life, its happiness,
its everything. To rest is to
rust.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Long-Headed In His Views.</h4>

<p class='c017'>He was long-headed in his views. More
than a century ago his advice for a large
city was: “Build high, as there is only
one ground rent.” He would have none
but solid construction.</p>

<p class='c015'>A farm near the city was his place of
recreation. On his journeys there his
lunch was under the seat, and on his
return the space was occupied with milk
and butter for his domestic use. But he
spent a great deal of money on the introduction
of rare plants and fine cattle. He
steadily declared that no man should be
an idler on his money, and he kept his
word.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is well said of him that “The spirit
of work made him active; the spirit of
justice made him exact; the spirit of
trade made him rich; the spirit of duty
made him brave; the spirit of patriotism
made him generous; and the spirit of love
made him great.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As a credit mark on the side of a vast
fortune Girard is conspicuous, and he
fully succeeded in not dying rich, for he
gave all to his fellow citizens, making
sure that it would be safeguarded for that
purpose forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Girard was a strange character. Penurious
about small things, disagreeable
in his personality, he was generous,
beneficent, and public-spirited in a large
way.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>WHEN THE RICH MAN MARRIES A POOR GIRL</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>A Writer Asserts That Wealth’s Marriage Into the “Working Classes” Will Benefit the Race.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>It is not altogether increasing newspaper
sensationalism that indicates a
larger number of marriages between
rich men and poor girls. There are, it
seems safe to say, more and more such
marriages.</p>

<p class='c013'>The judge does not always ride sadly
away and leave Maud Müller raking
hay. Frequently he departs only to get
a marriage license and return post-haste.
And Maud drops her rake right
gladly and directs the way to the nearest
justice of the peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>Says the New York <cite>Medical Journal</cite>:</p>

<p class='c014'>Marriages are constantly occurring in
the United States between young men of
great wealth and young women engaged
in earning their own living; but, despite
the familiarity of the phenomenon, no
such marriage ever fails to cause apparently
astonished comment, and, above all,
copious newspaper gossip.</p>

<p class='c015'>In Europe, where those who have inherited
wealth are taught and really believe
that they are of superior clay to
the class of inherited poverty, and the
latter assent to the teaching, such alliances
may well cause a slight shock,
diluted perhaps with some pleasure at
the condescension of the man.</p>

<p class='c015'>In our country, however, where one
family can hardly have the pas of another
by a single century, astonishment is ridiculous
and out of place. Few of our richest
men are idle, and their work differs
only in magnitude from that of the poor.</p>

<p class='c015'>If we grant that a century of idleness
can enervate a family, a marriage into
the “working classes” can only be beneficial.
Stock must be enriched from time
to time from near the soil.</p>

<p class='c015'>Advocates of highly restricted interbreeding
are fond of pointing to the race-horse
as a superior product of their principles.
A race-horse, however, is a poor
creature from the point of view of usefulness;
he is a beautiful specialized bundle
of nerves, and requires more coddling
than a healthy human baby.</p>

<p class='c015'>Interbreeding does not work out well
in the human species; the haughty Austrian
aristocracy, which considers the nobility
of France and England as upstarts,
and ostracizes any member who marries
into a family much younger than the
Cæsars, is not as a class strong and
healthy.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is from Austria in great measure
that our circuses secure their giants and
midgets, and many other of the various
“freaks,” objects of interest certainly,
but hardly of pride.</p>

<p class='c015'>Intellectually, we do not think that the
statesmen of Austria, Spain, and Russia
are the equals of those of France and the
United States, while the English commoners
have given a remarkable account of
themselves.</p>

<p class='c015'>We should be disposed to applaud the
good sense of any rich young American
who married a beautiful girl of poor but
decent antecedents, in spite of the fact
that such marriages depend upon unreasoning
sexual attraction, like the great
majority of marriages. As it is, we can
only note the care Nature takes of a race,
however heedless she may be of the individual.</p>

    <div>Considerable Discussion Is Provoked by Vice-Chancellor Pitney’s Assertion That She Does Not.</div>

been strongly controverted. Thus the
New York <cite>World</cite> says:</p>

<p class='c014'>The stepmother of fiction has a sharp
face and a sharp tongue, and rarely
misses an opportunity to wound sensitive
young souls.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the stepmother of fact is usually
quite a different person. Certain individuals
of scientific habits who have dabbled
in the domestic relations believe
that it would be better for most children
if they could be brought up by stepmothers
instead of mothers.</p>

<p class='c015'>The stepmother generally has all the
maternal instinct that any healthy child
needs, while she is not likely to be a
victim of the delusion that her stepchildren
are so much better than other
people’s children that it is an impenetrable
mystery why they do not die young.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, of course, there are stepmothers
and stepmothers, and doubtless the woman
who makes a poor stepmother would
make a poor mother if she had children
of her own.</p>

<p class='c015'>As a popular prejudice the aversions
to stepmothers has little more basis in
fact than the aversion to mothers-in-law.
Most men, in spite of the professional humorists,
are on excellent terms with their
mothers-in-law, and most women who
have married daughters are excessively
fond of their sons-in-law. At its best the
mother-in-law joke was never a very good
joke. Its humor consists largely in its
not being true.</p>

<p class='c015'>Vice-Chancellor Pitney may know a
good deal about the kind of stepmothers
who get into court, but the opinion of
Abraham Lincoln about stepmothers is
more valuable, because he was brought
up by one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Macon (Georgia) <cite>Telegraph</cite> indicates
why stepmothers may do better
for children than a mother can.</p>

<p class='c014'>The one defect in the God-like mother
love is the inability to view her offspring
with an impartial eye, and see them as
others see them. And it would be far
from a bold estimate to venture that the
majority of men who get into trouble
in later life turn their thoughts back at
such times to an irresponsible childhood
when a devoted and indulgent mother’s
love stood between them and the penalties
of all childish misdeeds.</p>

<p class='c015'>The stepmother, on the other hand, endowed,
as a rule, with the maternal affection
that springs eternal in the woman’s
breast, but unblinded by the other’s bias
for the children of her flesh, more frequently
approaches her often thankless
task, governed by a sense of duty, rather
than by affection merely, and many have
there been as a result, both men and
women, Vice-Chancellor Pitney’s dictum
to the contrary notwithstanding, to rise
up and call the stepmother blessed.</p>

<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Refutation of Statement That Our Ancestors Were Wont to Dine on Pork and Doughnuts.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>One English historian began to
write a history of the United
States, from the adoption of the
Constitution to the fall of the Republic.
The battle of Gettysburg stopped him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Professor John Mason Tyler, of Amherst,
lecturing at the University of
Chicago, said that climate had been the
principal cause of America’s phenomenal
development, and that climate ultimately
would cause its degeneracy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Baltimore <cite>American</cite> argues
against Professor Tyler, as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>Says the frenzied prophet: “Americans
one hundred years ago lived on pork and
doughnuts to a great extent. Before
going to bed they were not satisfied unless
they ate a large piece of mince-pie.
We say to-day, ‘What a barbarous bill of
fare!’ We, who can’t stand anything
stronger than tea and crackers.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In this lively sketch that, in a breath,
spans a century and grasps unerringly
the social and culinary philosophy of a
people, the learned professor has done
credit to the environment of his lecture.
The doughnut philosophy here propounded
is worthy to rank with the potato
philosophy of an economic school that
has long gone into extinction, while the
dire predictions it made are embalmed in
the history of intellectual errors.</p>

<p class='c015'>The notion of a doughnut and salt pork
diet, with a hunk of mince-pie as a nightcap,
is a gentle evolution in social fiction.
The American palate of a hundred years
ago was as susceptible to the temptation
of fried chicken and apple cider as it is
to-day.</p>

<p class='c015'>If the Amherst teacher could sit down
to the cuisine upon which the Americans
of a hundred years ago dined, he would
be apt to revise his estimate of it as a
“barbarous diet.” If he does not believe
this, let him peruse a colonial cook-book,
but with the warning that thereafter the
diet of the present day will appear flaccid
and unprofitable.</p>

<p class='c015'>As to the charge that we of this age
coddle our palates with tea and crackers,
let the anemic professor speak for himself.
The healthy American digestion
tackles fearlessly canvasback duck, diamondback
terrapin, and Welsh rarebit,
highly condimented and in complemental
relation with beverages more exhilarating,
though, perhaps, less deadly, than
tea, and his slumber makes no record
of a wrecking of the American constitution
by nightmares or disturbing physical
emotions.</p>

<p class='c015'>The breakdown of the American nation
is conditional upon the collapse of
the American constitution, then long
after Macaulay’s solitary New Zealander
seats himself on a broken span of London
Bridge to view the débris of the English
nation, the Stars and Stripes will still be
waving over the American “constitution.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In the meanwhile, some consolation
may be derived from the fact that the
American type of soldier is the finest the
world affords. Darwin drew attention to
the fact that the European in the American
army tended to conform to the American
type in stature and vigor under the
influence of the American climate.</p>

<div class='c014'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_182.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Just a century ago, in 1806, was born Nathaniel
Parker Willis, in Portland, Maine.
Willis was a fellow townsman of Longfellow,
but while the latter finally made his
way to Boston and Cambridge, Willis found
New York the most congenial residence.
There he was successively editor of the
<cite>Mirror</cite>, the <cite>Corsair</cite>, and the <cite>Home Journal</cite>,
enlivening their pages with an inexhaustible
supply of witty, well-timed, and sometimes
brilliant prose and verse. He was the first American to write
<i>vers de société</i> that deserved preservation, and that were at once
light, amusing, and in good taste.</p>

<p class='c015'>Willis affected an extreme elegance in dress, manner, and
surroundings. He pretended to write amid rare flowers, with old
vines beside him, and to use an amber penholder in the summer
to cool his palm. Those who disliked this display of foppery were
wont to explain the initials of his name as representing “Namby-Pamby.”
But with all his superficial frivolity, Willis was a man of
genuine talent. His early poems were quite as popular as Longfellow’s.
He was the first American author to make a good living wholly
by his pen. He discovered and gave substantial aid to many
younger men of genius, among them James Russell Lowell and
Bayard Taylor, and he first drew the attention of his countrymen
to the great gifts of Thackeray, long before “Vanity Fair” had
been written, and while the future novelist was still known only
as a writer for the English magazines. He even engaged Thackeray
to contribute a series of papers from Paris to the New York
<cite>Corsair</cite>—this as far back as 1838. Willis also, in his own letters
from Europe, created a model for all foreign correspondents since
that time; and his collected epistles, “Pencilings by the Way,”
still remain the most vivid sketches in existence of the men and
women who were famous when Victoria first became queen.</p>

<p class='c015'>The little poem here reprinted is one of the light, half-mocking
productions, which its author wrote to amuse his urban
public. It voices the sentiment of the young-man-about-town in
the New York of the early fifties. Perhaps the best comment
upon it is the fact that Willis himself, whenever he could possibly
do so, was accustomed to leave the city and enjoy the rustic pleasures
of his own country-house at Idlewild on the Hudson.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Possibly, on account of this epitaph
which Shakespeare had inscribed
above his grave in the
church of Stratford-on-Avon
and which it would need a bold
man to disregard now, the ashes of the
great dramatist have been more fortunate
than those of many distinguished
men. Despite our inherent horror of
disturbing the dead and our respect for
the grave as consecrated ground, changed
conditions, and, in some cases, mere
curiosity, have made the list of celebrities
whose bones have been moved a long
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>History shows that in securing immunity
for one’s grave, neither the lapse
of centuries nor past greatness is of any
avail. It is on record that in the chaos
of the end of the ninth century a pope
had the body of his predecessor dug from
the tomb, dressed it in its pontifical vestments,
and had it tried and condemned
by a synod. The hideous mockery terminated
only when the mutilated body was
thrown into the Tiber.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Dead Pope on Trial.</h3>

<p class='c018'>This scene, which marks the lowest
point to which civil war and anarchy in
Rome reduced the papacy, took place in
February or March of 897. About
eleven months before, Pope Formosus
had died after a stormy pontificate of
five years. He was followed to the
grave in fifteen days by his successor.
Then Stephen VI seated himself in the
chair of St. Peter. Stephen belonged to
the faction opposed to Formosus’s ally,
Arnulf of Germany. Party feeling and
party hatred ran high. The men temporarily
in power had injuries to avenge,
and Stephen, in a fit of almost insane
fury, determined to try his predecessor.</p>

<p class='c013'>On what charge the dead Formosus
was actually tried is not now very clear—probably
this detail was never considered
of much importance. Stephen
summoned a synod, dragged the corpse
out of the grave, dressed it in its full
pontifical robes and himself presided
over the court. He made no pretence
of being an impartial judge, however.
Paying no attention to the trembling deacon
to whom had been assigned the hopeless
task of defending the dead Pope,
Stephen turned savagely on the corpse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why hast thou in thy ambition
usurped the Apostolic Seat, who wast
previously only Bishop of Portus?” he
demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>The synod played out its part in the
wretched farce. Formosus was convicted
and solemnly deposed. The vestments
were torn from the body of the
dead pontiff, the three fingers of the
right hand used in bestowing the benediction
were cut off and the mummy,
hauled through the streets by the mob,
was thrown into the Tiber. A few
months later Stephen was strangled in
his palace.</p>

<p class='c013'>Equally brutal was the treatment given
to Cromwell’s body when the Restoration
brought Charles II back to England
and the cavaliers to power. Cromwell
had directed that his interment be
in Westminster Abbey, and every effort
was made to have his funeral as impressive
as that of any crowned king. The
attempt, however, was not altogether
successful. In his famous diary John
Evelyn notes:</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Cromwell’s Body Hanged.</h3>

<p class='c018'>“It was the joyfullest funeral that
ever I saw, for there were none that cried
but dogs, which the soldiers hooted away
with as barbarous noise, drinking, and
taking tobacco in the streets.”</p>

<p class='c013'>On the eve of January 30, 1661, the
bodies of Cromwell, Ireton, and the regicide
Bradshaw were dug from their
graves. The next day they were dragged
to Tyburn and hanged with their faces to
Westminster Hall, where they had sentenced
Charles to death. The corpses
were buried at the foot of the gallows,
where Connaught Square is now, and the
heads, impaled on pikes, remained for
years above the entrance of Westminster
Hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>After many years a high wind carried
the head of the Lord Protector down.
A soldier made off with it, and in 1779
it was on exhibition in Old Bond Street.
A private family is now in possession of
the ghastly relic—the features so well
preserved that the large wart over one
eye which was so noticeable in life is
still plainly visible.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Wyclif’s Bones Burned.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The bones of Wyclif were treated in
much the same way by the Council of
Constance, in 1414, though there was, in
his case, more of ceremony and less of
mere hatred. The remains of the English
reformer were burned and the ashes
thrown into a brook, which, of course,
ultimately emptied into the ocean.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thus,” says one writer, “the ashes
of Wyclif are the emblem of his doctrine,
which now is dispersed all the
world over.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But it is not always the enemies of
the dead who disturb their bones. There
is no more remarkable tradition than the
crowning of the dead Queen Inez de
Castro when her lord, young Pedro,
ascended the throne of Portugal in the
fourteenth century. The death of Inez,
murdered by the command of her father-in-law,
Alfonso XII, had been avenged
by Don Pedro, but the torture of the assassins
did not satisfy the prince.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Queen’s Skeleton Crowned.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The tradition is to the effect, it is said,
that when Pedro came to the throne a
few years later, he had the bones of Inez
taken from the grave, placed upon a
magnificent throne, robed in royal purple,
and crowned queen of Portugal. To
the skeleton the courtiers did homage,
one after another kissing the fleshless
hand in which the scepter had been
thrust. Then, lying in her rich robes,
her crown upon her grinning skull, in a
chariot drawn by twenty coal-black
mules and with a funeral cortège which
extended several miles, the skeleton of
Inez was driven to the royal abbey of
Alcobaca, where the bones were reinterred.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even then, however, the dead queen
was not to be left in peace. In 1810 the
French troops broke into the abbey of
Alcobaca, destroyed the magnificent
monument which Pedro had erected, and
tore open the coffin. The yellow hair of
the queen was cut from the skull and preserved
in reliquaries.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Reburial of Napoleon.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Like those of Inez, the bones of Napoleon
were buried a second time with all
the pomp and ceremony that a great nation
could devise. The body of the great
emperor was originally buried under a
weeping willow in a secluded hollow
among the rocks of Saint Helena. With
the Revolution of 1830, however, came a
change in the political situation, and
this made it possible for the remains of
the conqueror to be removed from the
lonely island-grave to the magnificent
tomb under the dome of the Hôtel des
Invalides.</p>

<p class='c013'>The body was exhumed at midnight
on the twenty-fifth anniversary of Napoleon’s
arrival at Saint Helena. For nine
hours the engineers labored to dig away
the earth from the vault, to remove the
solid masonry and to lift the heavy slab
which covered the sarcophagus. Within
a triple coffin of tin, lead, and mahogany
lay the emperor, dressed in white
waistcoat and breeches, black cravat,
long boots and cocked hat, with the
cloak he wore at Marengo spread over
his feet.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Body of André Disinterred.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The year that Napoleon died the body
of Major John André was taken back
to England. André had been buried in
a field close to the spot where he had
been hanged as a spy, and the grave was
marked by two small cedars and by a
peach-tree planted at its head. Some
of the newspapers had declared that
“any honor paid Major André’s remains
was casting an imputation on General
Washington and the officers who tried
him.” Such logic as this had so stirred
some ultra-patriotic citizens of Tappan
that when Mr. Buchanan, the British
consul in New York, arrived there to exhume
the body quite a crowd was prepared
to express its emphatic disapproval.</p>

<p class='c013'>Argument being obviously of no avail,
Buchanan told the little mob that it
was an Irish custom to drink spirits before
visiting a grave and that this custom
he always observed. In a few minutes
the crowd was too much occupied
with the Irish custom to annoy Buchanan
and the consul proceeded with
his task.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lid of the coffin was found to be
broken and the roots of the peach-tree
had entwined themselves completely
around the skull. The bones were taken
to a house near by, whence warned of
rumors that the body would be flung
into the river, Buchanan was obliged to
carry off the coffin like a thief in the
night, driving twenty-four miles to New
York.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Corpse of Paul Jones Identified.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The recovery of the body of John
Paul Jones is still fresh in the public
mind. Unearthed after a protracted
search in an abandoned Paris cemetery,
the features and body were so well preserved
that there could be no doubt of
the identity. Once this was established,
the transfer of the body from French to
American soil was made the occasion
of a solemn ceremony, in the course
of which five hundred. American bluejackets
marched through the streets of
Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>The remains of Jones, André, and Napoleon
were exhumed in order that they
might be buried again with greater
honor. In Westminster Abbey mere accident
or curiosity has several times disturbed
the rest of the famous dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>The body of Ben Jonson has been especially
unfortunate. Having obtained
a grant of “eighteen inches of square
ground” in the Abbey, the poet was said
to have been buried there in an upright
position with the famous epitaph, “O
Rare Ben Jonson,” over his head. In
1849 a new grave was being dug close
by when loose sand poured in and the
clerk saw:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The two leg-bones of Jonson fixed
bolt upright in the sand as though the
body had been buried in the upright
position, and the skull came rolling down
among the sand, from a position above
the leg-bones, to the bottom of the newly
made grave. There was still hair upon
it and it was of a red color.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Pope’s Skull in Museum.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Another poet has suffered in much
the same manner. The skull of Alexander
Pope is now in a private museum.
On some occasion the coffin was opened
and a phrenologist gave two hundred and
fifty dollars to the sexton to be allowed
to take the skull home overnight. In
the morning another skull was substituted
and the poet’s deposited in the
phrenologist’s museum.</p>

<p class='c013'>Against the curiosity of science there
is no safeguard. Recently Kaiser Wilhelm
had the grave of Charlemagne at
Aix-la-Chapelle opened again, this time
for the purpose of photographing the
fabrics in which the hero was wrapped.
Against this violation of the sepulcher
Jules Claretie, in an article written
for the Paris <cite>Figaro</cite> and translated for
the Boston <cite>Transcript</cite>, has protested
vigorously. Claretie says:</p>

<p class='c014'>After such combats, labors, and mighty
thoughts, he dreamed of repose, like the
poet Moses. Repose! There is none in
this world for the illustrious dead. We
waken them through mere curiosity.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>At Charlemagne’s Tomb.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Charlemagne’s grandsons believed that
they were heirs to his glory because for
a moment they looked upon his skeleton
or exposed his remains to view.</p>

<p class='c015'>Otho first opened the sepulcher. Cornélius
has depicted that fantastic scene
in a celebrated fresco. Frederick Barbarossa
followed Otho’s example. He stood
alive before the corpse. On his stone
throne, he contemplated the emperor,
with huge hand grasping the scepter and
the globe.</p>

<p class='c015'>Then the dead Charlemagne was torn
from his marble resting-place; his skull
and the bones of his arms went to enrich
the treasure of the cathedral crypt. The
throne became sacred in the eyes of emperors,
and Charlemagne—mutilated and
dismembered—was partially restored to
his marble vault.</p>

<p class='c015'>Barbarossa was more fortunate; he
was drowned in the Cydnus, and no one
could profane his body.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another emperor—Napoleon, in 1804—wanted
in his turn to behold the fantom.
Bareheaded and preceded by Duroc,
the emperor contemplated the sacred
bones.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So this is he who was master of the
world!”</p>

<p class='c015'>And Napoleon, deeply moved, turned
toward Canon Camus.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Pray, Monsieur l’Abbé; pray for
France, whose greatness Charlemagne
founded.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then, when the stone had been replaced,
Napoleon vouchsafed the “fantom
emperor” a renewal of slumber.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Removed Emperor’s Shrouds.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Victor Hugo, while walking through
Aix-la-Chapelle, complained even then of
the innumerable violations to which the
great Charlemagne’s tomb had been subjected.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Some day,” said he, “I suppose that a
pious and holy thought will enter the
mind of some king or emperor. Charlemagne’s
remains will be taken from the
chest where the sacristans put them
and again laid in his tomb.</p>

<p class='c015'>“What is left of his bones will be religiously
reassembled. He will regain his
Byzantine vault, his bronze doors, and
his marble armchair with its fourteen
plates of gold, and the kneeling visitor
will be enabled to behold, gleaming
vaguely in the darkness, that fantom—crown
on head and orb in hand—that
once was Charlemagne.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Well, no such thing was accomplished.
Once more the dignitaries of the empire
have assembled to open a coffin. The
two shrouds that enveloped Charlemagne
have been removed—those Oriental fabrics
that some calif had sent to the
emperor—and since, as the telegraphic
despatches say, “the light was not sufficient
to operate,” they have been sent to
a Friedrichstrasse photographer, who will
find light enough, egad!</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Voltaire and Rousseau.</h3>

<p class='c017'>We have dug up Richelieu, opened Bossuet’s
tomb, disturbed the great Napoleon’s
coffin. A few years ago I saw
the sarcophagi of Voltaire and Rousseau
opened at the Panthéon. I saw the skull
of the author of “Candide” passed from
hand to hand; I saw men’s finger-nails
scratch away its reddish coating (probably
due, as Monsieur Berthelot told us,
to the sublimate that had preserved the
corpse).</p>

<p class='c015'>In his leaden coffin, with arms crossed
upon his breast, I saw the man who had
written “The Social Contract”; I saw
the onlookers—indifferent or curious—poke
their fingers into the empty sockets
now bereft of those eyes that had once
gazed upon Madame de Warrens, or try
to snatch from a jaw-bone—“as a souvenir,
monsieur!”—one of those teeth that
had touched cherries picked In Madame
Gallet’s company.</p>

<p class='c015'>I was present at that Dance of Death
which men call “an historical exhumation.”
And the inevitable photographer
was there at the Panthéon, just as at
Aix-la-Chapelle. Great men’s bones are
hustled about, their skulls are pried into
and weighed, as if, forsooth, some sparkle
of genius could be got out of them!</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Edward the Confessor.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Other kings than Charlemagne have
had their slumbers broken. Since the
coffin of Edward the Confessor was
placed, on January 6, 1066, before the
high altar of Westminster Abbey it has
been opened for one purpose or another
three times. Venerated as the last lineal
descendant of Cedric, Edward was
buried in his full regalia, the crown on
his head, the gold crucifix in his hand,
and the pilgrim’s ring, said to have belonged
to St. John, on his finger.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was thus that the body was found
when Bishop Gundulf opened the coffin
thirty years later and plucked a hair
from the dead king’s long white beard.
The coffin was opened again when Edward
was canonized in 1163, and the
body of the saint was then found to be
in complete preservation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Abbot Laurence, however, was harder
to satisfy than Gundulf. From the dead
man’s finger he took the ring of St. John,
depositing it in the abbey treasury as a
relic, and the vestments in which the
corpse was wrapped were made into three
magnificent copes. Another century
passed and then Henry III had the coffin
opened, when he removed it to the
east of the high altar, where it has since
remained.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Identifying Dead Kings.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Equally troubled has been the repose
of Edward I, “The Hammer of the
Scots.” When the old warrior died in
1307, he ordered that his flesh should be
boiled and his bones carried at the head
of an English army until Scotland
should be conquered. Though this wish
was calmly disregarded, one custom
which antiquarians have been at a loss
to explain, may be in some way connected
with it. Until the overthrow of
Richard III on Bosworth Field ended
the Plantagenet rule, the tomb of Edward
I was opened every two years and
the cerecloth renewed. With the Tudors
this strange rite fell into disuse.</p>

<p class='c013'>For three hundred years the body of
Edward was left in the tomb in peace.
Then the Society of Antiquarians opened
the coffin in 1771. The king was lying
in his royal robes, the “long shanks”
from which he derived his nickname,
covered with a cloth of gold. Six feet
two inches was the dead man’s height.
Lean and straight as he was, Edward I
must have been an imposing figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>Only two other kings of England—James
I and Charles I—have been
exhumed. Their coffins were opened for
the purpose of identification. James
had the body of his mother, Mary Queen
of Scots, taken from Fotheringay to
Westminster but, on the whole, the royal
family of England has been little disturbed.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>French Royal Tombs Robbed.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Not so the French. For three days in
the Reign of Terror a Paris mob raged
in the abbey church of St. Denis, which
for centuries was the chosen burying-place
of the French kings. In this sanctuary
of the Old Régime the mob respected
nothing. The silk robes were
torn from the bodies of Hugues Capet,
Philip the Hardy, and Philip the Fair.</p>

<p class='c013'>A handful of gray dust, all that was
left of Pepin, the father of Charlemagne,
was flung to the wind, and one
after another, Capetians, Valois, and
Bourbons were dragged from the tomb
and tumbled into a trench. On the pavement,
one eye-witness says, rolled the
heads of Louis XII and Francis I, of
Marshal Turenne and of the great Constable
Duguesclin.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a short time the corpse of Henry
IV, the most popular of all the long line
of French kings, was respected. Embalmed
with the best Italian skill, and
so well preserved that the two fatal dagger
wounds in the chest were still plainly
visible, the body lay untouched for
two days. Then some one shouted that
Henry, like all the rest, had deceived the
people, and his body, too, was flung into
the trench.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the Restoration an attempt was
made to return the royal bodies to their
tombs, but it was not altogether successful.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>St. Swithin’s Troubled Rest.</h3>

<p class='c018'>If one passes from secular history to
the legends of the saints, the exhumations
become innumerable. It is, tradition
asserts, on account of an attempt to
remove the body of St. Swithin that we
owe the prediction:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>St. Swithun’s day, if thou dost rain,</div>
      <div class='line'>For forty days it will remain:</div>
      <div class='line'>St. Swithun’s day, if thou be fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>For forty days ’twill rain na mair.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>St. Swithin, chiefly notable for his
mildness and humility, ordered that he
should not be buried in his cathedral of
Winchester, but in a “vile and unworthy
place” among the common people in the
churchyard. This the monks could not
bring themselves to consider right, and
on one July 15, they attempted to move
the body of the bishop into the cathedral.
But on that day and for forty days thereafter
it rained so hard that they finally
recognized in the weather the anger of
the saint and abandoned their idea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Apparently, however, the good saint
changed his mind half a century or
so later, for his remains were then
brought into the cathedral and, instead
of manifesting any displeasure, two hundred
miraculous cures were credited to
him in ten days.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Despite All the Advantages That Have Resulted from Modern Invention, Artists, Architects, and Engineers of the Present Time Are Dwarfed by Those Who Wrought the Marvels of Ancient and Medieval Days.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>There are two groups of “wonders
of the world,” the first belonging
to the period which we distinguish
by the term antiquity, and the second to
the Middle Ages. Considering the lack
of facilities for building in the earlier
period, it seems that the wonders of antiquity
are much more remarkable than
those of the medieval age; but these are
stupendous marvels also, and deserve
their fame, every one.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Pyramids of Egypt rank first,
being the oldest as well as the most permanent
things which man has ever built.
They are situated in middle Egypt, and
there are now in existence some seventy-five;
of this number there are some which
are crumbling into shapeless masses, but
the group of Ghizeh, which is the most important,
stands in sturdy and unyielding
strength.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Pyramids are the tombs of Egypt’s
dead kings, and date back to the Fourth
Dynasty—about three thousand years before
Christ. The largest covers an area
of nearly thirteen acres, was originally
four hundred and eighty-one feet high,
and had a length on each side, at the
base, of seven hundred and fifty-five feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were
built by Nebuchadnezzar for his queen,
Amytis, and their site has been located at
the northern end of the city. They consisted
of a series of terraces rising to a
considerable height, and laid out as a
park; it is probable that such gardens
would have been near to or adjoining the
king’s palace, but whether or not they
were has not as yet been discovered. The
reign of Nebuchadnezzar was about 600
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c015'>The Tomb of Mausolus, King of Caria,
at Halicarnassus, was built about 352 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
From this great monument, built by the
king’s widow, Artemisia, as a memorial to
him, the word mausoleum of our common
speech is derived. The tomb seems to
have been preserved up to the twelfth
century, but earthquakes probably started
its ruin soon after this, and the stones
from it have been used in many other
buildings, so that now even its general
appearance can only be guessed at.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was
built at the public charge, though King
Crœsus is believed to have contributed
largely to it. It was one hundred and
sixty-four by three hundred and forty-two
and a half feet, and the height of its
columns was fifty-five feet. It was begun
in the sixth century before Christ, and
one hundred and twenty years are said
to have elapsed before it was completed.
It was the seat of the worship of the
goddess Diana.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of
Helios, the sun-god, which was made from
the spoils left by Demetrius when the city
was successfully defended against him,
after a long siege. Its construction occupied
the artist twelve years. It stood
near the harbor, but not across the entrance,
as was at one time supposed. It
was erected about 280 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and thrown
down by an earthquake some sixty-six
years later. Its height was something
over one hundred feet.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Statue of Jupiter at Olympia was
the work of the greatest sculptor of ancient
Greece, Phidias by name, who was
born about 490 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> This heroic figure
was about forty-two feet high, and represented
the god seated on a throne. It
was made of ivory and gold.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Pharos of Egypt was begun under
Ptolemy I, and was finished by his son
about 282 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> It was a lofty tower, built
on the eastern extremity of the rocky
island from which it took its name, and
was the great lighthouse at the entrance
to the harbor of Alexandria. The light
was furnished by a beacon-fire on its
summit. Its height was four hundred and
fifty feet, and the light could be seen at
a distance of one hundred miles.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Palace of Cyrus, the founder of the
Persian Empire, is also mentioned as one
of the wonders of the ancient world,
though the preference is given to the
Pharos of Egypt by the best authorities.
This palace was cemented with gold.</p>

<p class='c015'>The wonders of the Middle Ages seem
quite modern compared with the marvels
of the ancient world, long since crumbled
into dust.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Colosseum of Rome heads the later
list. This was built by Vespasian, and
dedicated by his son Titus, in 80 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> According
to a document of the fourth century,
this great amphitheater seated
eighty-seven thousand persons, its dimensions
being six hundred and seventeen
by five hundred and twelve feet. It
was the scene of the bloody sports in
which the Romans delighted, and of the
martyrdom of many of the early Christians.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Catacombs of Rome, the earliest
burial places of the Christians, are outside
the city walls, within a radius of
three miles; they were excavated wherever
the soil was suitable for such tunneling,
but were not secretly made, as the old
tradition would have us believe. Their
length has been estimated variously at
from three hundred and fifty to eight hundred
miles, and the number of dead which
they contain is from six to seven millions.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Great Wall of China was built by
the founder of the Tsin dynasty, in 256
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Its length was once more than one
thousand two hundred and fifty miles, and
it is the largest defensive work in the
world, being thirty-five feet high and
twenty-one feet thick. It follows an irregular
course, marking the northern
boundary of the empire, and is not deflected
by natural obstacles. There are
towers at frequent intervals, presumably
for lookout.</p>

<p class='c015'>Stonehenge is the most remarkable example
of the ancient stone circles and
stands, a magnificent ruin, on Salisbury
Plain, in Wiltshire, southern England. It
is at least as early as the Bronze Age,
according to the most modern research,
and that was from 2000 to 1800 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> From
the arrangement of the stones with reference
to the sun, It is believed to have had
some connection with sun worship.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is the most
remarkable of these slanting campaniles,
though not by any means the only one.
It was begun in 1174 and finished in 1350.
Its height is one hundred and eighty-one
feet, and it is fifty-one and a half feet
in diameter at the base. It inclines
thirteen feet eight inches toward the
south. The opinion prevails now that
the slant is intentional in all these leaning
towers, though the reason for it is
not clear.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Porcelain Tower of Nanking, which
was erected early in the fifteenth century,
was an octagonal structure, faced
with variegated porcelain. Lamps and
bells were hung from it. It was destroyed
by the Taipings in 1853, but many miniatures
of it are in existence in various parts
of the world.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Mosque of St. Sophia, in Constantinople,
is one of the most magnificent
edifices in the world. It was begun by
Justinian in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 532 and was completed
in five years. Originally it was named the
Church of St. Sophia. Its walls were decorated
with beautiful mosaics, which have
been partly effaced or partly covered with
inscriptions from the Koran. It was converted
into a mosque by Mohammed II, in
1453, and four minarets were added, while
the golden cross was replaced by the crescent.
Its dome is one hundred and five
feet in diameter and one hundred and
eighty-four feet high inside.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>IRON IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Original Find Was in North Carolina, While the First Attempt to Manufacture It Was Made in Virginia in 1619.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Iron is, fortunately, the most abundant
of metals as well as the most
useful, and is to be found in almost
all parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first recorded find was in North
Carolina in 1585, while the first effort to
manufacture it was made in Virginia in
1619.</p>

<p class='c014'>The works were destroyed by Indians
in 1622. The next attempt was at Lynn,
Massachusetts, where a blast furnace
was started in 1643, which produced
some “sow” iron in 1645, and where a
forge was built in 1648. Bog-ore was
generally used in New England in colonial
days.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first export of iron (bar) to England
was made in 1717, and the first
pig-iron in 1728. Up to 1720, Massachusetts
was the chief seat of the iron industry
in the colonies. In the year 1750,
Pennsylvania became the leading iron-producing
colony.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Harp of a Thousand Strings.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>A Quaint Specimen of the Sermons Preached by Itinerant Exhorters in the South in the Middle of the Last Century—Now Almost Forgotten, It Had the Whole Country Laughing Fifty Years Ago.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='double'>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c023'>The droll little sketch entitled “The Harp of a Thousand Strings” appeared
many years ago in a New Orleans newspaper. While Joshua
S. Morris is generally credited with the authorship, the claims of others
have been advanced from time to time, and the authorship appears to be
almost as cloudy as the identity of the writers of “Laugh and the World
Laughs With You,” “Casey at the Bat,” and “If I Should Die To-Night.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But, however cloudy may be the identity of the author, there is no suggestion
of haziness about the humor which invests the sketch itself. “The
Harp of a Thousand Strings” had scarcely more than attained the dignity
of print when it was pounced upon by nearly every elocutionist and chronic
story-teller in the country. Hundreds of newspapers reprinted it, and in
England it was frequently quoted as an admirable example of American
humor.</p>

<p class='c015'>All this popularity was too much for it, however. Gorged with prosperity,
it lay down to a Rip Van Winkle slumber from which it has just
been awakened for the readers of <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>. Like Rip Van Winkle,
“The Harp of a Thousand Strings” finds that during its long sleep one
of its old friends has passed away. This Is the quaint old exhorter who,
combining business with theology, was so common in the South half a
century ago. Sometimes he was a pedler, a patent medicine man, a
lightning-rod agent, or, like the old fellow pictured in the sketch, a Mississippi
flat-boat captain in search of a cargo, or with liquor to sell.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>I may say to you, my brethring, that
I am not an edicated man, an’ I
am not one of them as believes that
edication is necessary for a Gospel
minister, for I believe the Lord
edicates His preachers jest as He wants
’em to be edicated; an’ although I say
it that oughtn’t to say it, yet in the State
of Indianny, whar I live, thar’s no man
as gets bigger congregations nor what I
gits.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thar may be some here to-day, my
brethring, as don’t know what persuasion
I am uv. Well, I must say to you, my
brethring, that I’m a Hard-shell Baptist.
Thar’s some folks as don’t like the Hard-shell
Baptists, but I’d rather have a hard
shell as no shell at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>You see me here to-day, my brethring,
dressed up in fine clothes; you mout
think I was proud, but I am not proud,
my brethring, and although I’ve been a
preacher of the Gospel for twenty years,
an’ although I’m capting of the flat-boat
that lies at your landing, I’m not proud,
my brethring.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am not gwine to tell edzactly whar
my tex may be found; suffice to say, it’s
in the leds of the Bible, and you’ll find it
somewhar between the first chapter of
the book of Generations and the last
chapter of the book of Revolutions, and
ef you’ll go and search the Scriptures,
you’ll not only find my tex thar, but a
great many other texes as will do you
good to read, and my tex, when you shall
find it, you shall find it to read thus:</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he played on a harp uv a
thousand strings, sperits uv jest men
made perfeck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>My text, my brethring, leads me to
speak of sperits. Now, thar’s a great
many kinds of sperits in the world—in
the fuss place, thar’s the sperits as some
folks call ghosts, and thar’s the sperits
of turpentine, and thar’s the sperits as
some folks call liquor, an’ I’ve got as
good an artikel of them kind of sperits
on my flat-boat as ever was fotch down
the Mississippi River; but thar’s a great
many other kinds of sperits, for the tex
says, “He played on a harp uv a
<i>t-h-o-u-s</i>-and strings, sperits uv jest men
made perfeck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But I tell you the kind uv sperits as is
meant in the tex is <span class='fss'>FIRE</span>. That’s the
kind uv sperits as is meant in the tex, my
brethring. Now, thar’s a great many
kinds of fire in the world. In the fuss
place, there’s the common sort of fire you
light your cigar or pipe with, and then
thar’s foxfire and camphire, fire before
you’re ready, and fire and fall back, and
many other kinds uv fire, for the tex says,
“He played on the harp uv a <i>thous</i>and
strings, sperits of jest men made perfeck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But I’ll tell you the kind of fire as
is meant in the tex, my brethring—it’s
<span class='fss'>HELL FIRE</span>, an’ that’s the kind uv
fire as a great many uv you’ll come to, ef
you don’t do better nor what you have
been doin’—for “He played on a harp
uv a <i>thous</i>and strings, sperits uv jest
men made perfeck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, the different sorts of fire in the
world may be likened unto the different
persuasions of Christians in the world.
In the first place, we have the Piscapalions,
an’ they are a high-sailin’ and
highfalutin’ set, and they may be likened
unto a turkey buzzard that flies up into
the air, and he goes up, and up, and up,
till he looks no bigger than your fingernail,
and the fust thing you know, he
cums down, and down, and down, and is
a-fillin’ himself on the carkiss of a dead
hoss by the side of the road, and “He
played on a harp uv a <i>thous</i>and strings,
sperits uv jest men made perfeck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then thar’s the Methodis, and
they may be likened unto the squirril
runnin’ up into a tree, for the Methodis
beleeves in gwine on from one degree of
grace to another, and finally on to perfection,
and the squirril goes up and up,
and up and up, and he jumps from limb
to limb, and branch to branch, and the
fust thing you know he falls, and down
he cums kerflumix, and that’s like the
Methodis, for they is allers fallen from
grace, ah! and “He played on a harp uv
a <i>thous</i>and strings, sperits of jest men
made perfeck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, my brethring, thar’s the
Baptist, ah! and they have been likened
unto a ’possum on a ’simmon tree, and
thunders may roll and the earth may
quake, but that ’possum clings thar still,
ah! and you may shake one foot loose,
and the other’s thar, and you may shake
all feet loose, and he laps his tail around
the limb, and clings, and he clings furever,
for “He played on the harp uv a
<i>thous</i>and strings, sperits uv jest men
made perfeck.”</p>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='under'>A Startling Summons.</span></div>

<p class='c013'>An error for which nervousness may have
been responsible, was that made by the boy
who was told to take the Bishop’s shaving water to him one morning and cautioned
to answer the Bishop’s inquiry “Who’s there,” by saying, “The boy, my Lord.”
Whether from nervousness or not, the boy managed to transpose the words of this
sentence with ludicrous effect, and the Bishop was surprised and perhaps alarmed
to hear in response to his inquiry the answer, “The Lord, my boy.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Effects of Music on Animals.</h2>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>A Pigeon Was One of Mozart’s Most Appreciative Auditors—Cats, Mice, and Cows Have Performed Queer Antics When Under the Influence of Strains from Violins and Pianos.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The power of music is growing to be
recognized by physicians in the
treatment of certain diseases. Its
effect upon animals is very marked,
sometimes for good and in other instances
for quite the opposite, though it
is not always easy to know just which is
the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>A writer in <cite>Harper’s Magazine</cite> half a
century ago gave some results of personal
observation of animals under the influence
of music. These observations are
interesting and amusing, and would
seem to show beyond a doubt that animals
may be quite as fond of sweet sounds
as man.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sensibility of animals to music will
hardly be questioned in the present day,
when the manners and habits of all animated
nature are so thoroughly observed
and studied.</p>

<p class='c015'>We no longer doubt the dictum of the
poet, who sings, “Music hath charms to
soothe the savage breast”; and, therefore,
it is not so much in corroboration
of his assertion, as in illustration of a fact
so interesting and pleasing in itself, that
we are about to bring to the notice of the
reader some few instances of animal love
of music which are too well authenticated
to admit of a doubt, and some of which
are the records of our personal observation
and experience.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Mozart and His Pigeon.</h3>

<p class='c017'>One of the German biographers of
Mozart makes mention of a tame pigeon,
which was the companion and pet of that
extraordinary genius when a child. The
bird, when at liberty, would never leave
the side of the young composer while he
was playing any instrument, and had to
be caught and confined in his cage to
prevent him from following his little
favorite from room to room.</p>

<p class='c015'>Whenever the boy came into the presence
of the pigeon, the latter manifested
the utmost uneasiness until he began to
play; if the door of the cage were opened,
the bird would fly to the violin and peck
at the strings, or to the harpsichord and
jump and flutter on the keys, and would
not be pacified until the child sat down
to play, when it would perch quietly on
his shoulder, and sit there for hours almost
without moving a feather.</p>

<p class='c015'>Cats have a species of undelightful
music of their own, performed, as we all
know, at unseasonable hours on the leads,
house-tiles, and garden-walls of our dwellings.
Puss’s performances are generally
too chromatic for ears not feline, and we
humans are given to disconcert their concertos
with a shower from the water-jug,
or anything else that comes to hand, when
their untimely carols rouse us from our
sleep.</p>

<p class='c015'>In revenge, puss is generally as indifferent
to the sublimest strains of the
human voice or cunningly played instrument
as any post can possibly be, and
prefers the untuneful scream of the cat’s-meat
man to the noblest compositions of
Beethoven.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Cats Have Musical Ears.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Still, as if nature was determined to
assert the triumph of harmony over every
living thing, now and then a cat turns up
who has a genuine musical ear, and will
manifest unequivocal satisfaction and
delight at harmonious combinations of
sound.</p>

<p class='c015'>We once owned a cat who would listen
complacently to music by the hour together,
always accompanying it with a
gentle purring—who would leave her
hunting-ground in garden or cellar whenever
music was going on in parlor or
drawing-room—who would scratch at the
door, and croon and mew to be let in,
and would resent a prolonged exclusion
by certain expressive displays of disapprobation.
When admitted, she would
leap on the piano, and attempt, after the
New Zealand fashion of expressing regard,
to rub noses with the performer.</p>

<p class='c015'>An old friend of ours reports another
instance, which is perhaps still more remarkable.
He was in the habit, most
evenings in the week, of spending an hour
or two at the piano after the studious
labors of the day.</p>

<p class='c015'>His pet cat, though as a kitten indifferent
to music, grew to like it, and
regularly led the way to the piano when
the business of the tea-table was done.
Here she took post on a chair, and listened
gravely during the whole performance.
When it ceased, and the instrument
was closed, she would return to the
rug, or to his knee, and sleep out the rest
of the evening.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>A Feline Paderewski.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Not so, however, if the piano was left
open; in that case, puss leaped on the
keys and pawed a performance of her own,
in which she showed an extreme partiality
for the treble notes, and something
like alarm at the big bass ones, when
she happened to give them an extra vigorous
kick with her heels. In fact, a
rousing discord would frighten her off
the keys, but she would return again and
soothe her feelings by a gentle pattering
among the upper notes.</p>

<p class='c015'>These exploits she repeated whenever
the piano was left open, and whether she
had auditors or not; so that it became
necessary to close the instrument or exclude
the cat from the room in order to
insure a moment’s quietness. If by any
chance her master spent the evening from
home, puss showed her disappointment
and dissatisfaction by restlessness and
ill-temper.</p>

<p class='c015'>Twenty-five years ago the writer was
one of a joint-stock proprietary who
owned a boat on an inland river, winding
through a retired and picturesque tract
of country. There were seven of us, all
being either singers or players of instruments;
and in this boat it was our custom
to spend an occasional leisure hour in
musical voyagings up and down the river.
To many an old English melody on these
occasions did the moss-covered rocks
and precipitous banks return harmonious
echoes.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>A Dancing Cow.</h3>

<p class='c017'>We made strange acquaintances on
those long voyages, up a stream navigated
by no other keel than ours, and, among
other natural curiosities, we fell in with
a musical cow. This creature, a small,
cream-colored specimen of the Alderney
breed, suckled her calf, along with a
dozen other vaccine mothers, in a
meadow which sloped down to the river’s
brink.</p>

<p class='c015'>Whenever we turned the bend of the
river, “with our voices in tune as the
oars kept time,” and the meadow came
in sight, there we were sure to see the
white cow, standing up to the shoulders
in the water, whither she had advanced
to meet us, her neck stretched out and
her dripping nose turned toward the boat.</p>

<p class='c015'>As we skirted the meadow, she kept
pace with us on the bank, testifying her
delight by antics of which no cow in
her senses would have been thought capable.
She would leap, skip, roll on her
back, rear on her hind legs, and then
hurl them aloft in the air like a kicking
horse—now rushing into the water to
look at us nearer, now frisking off like a
kitten at play.</p>

<p class='c015'>When she came to the meadow-fence,
she dashed through it furiously into the
next field, and so on through the next
fence, and the next after that. The
fourth being railed, she would turn it
by wading the river, and was only prevented
from following us farther by a
steep, precipitous bank which stopped her
progress.</p>

<p class='c015'>After these mad gambols, she always
returned to her calf, first saluting us with
a long, plaintive kind of bellow, by way
of farewell.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Violin Charms a Snake.</h3>

<p class='c017'>At this period it was that, rescuing a
fine snake from some ignorant boys who
were about to kill it, under the notion that
it was venomous, but who were glad to
sell it for twopence, we carried the slippery
creature home, and assigned him a
lodging in a small wicker basket, filled
with moss and suspended by a single
string from a hook in the ceiling of our
bachelor’s snuggery.</p>

<p class='c015'>The reptile grew to know us, and to
welcome us in his way, by gliding his cold
coil across our face and temples when we
brought him fresh moss, or tempted him
with food, which, by the way, he would
never take. It was by accident only that
we discovered his musical predilections.</p>

<p class='c015'>One evening, while marching the room
to the sound of our old violin, with which
it was our custom to beguile an occasional
hour, we caught sight of what seemed a
monstrous python threatening us from
aloft. It was the shadow of our pet snake,
projected by the single candle on the
table to the arched ceiling above, and
magnified to formidable looking dimensions.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fellow was hanging out of the basket
almost by the tip of his tall, and,
with his head stretched toward us, was
following our motions as we walked up
and down the room.</p>

<p class='c015'>We remembered the snake-charmers,
and conceived at once that it was the
music which had brought him out; and
so it proved, as we had opportunity
of certifying by repeated experiments.
Whenever he heard the violin he came
out, and always with his head in the
direction of the sound, as if anxious to
reach it. When taken from the basket
and hung around the neck, he lay limp
and as if lifeless while the music lasted,
and did not immediately recover when it
had ceased.</p>

<p class='c015'>One day, on finding that he made no appearance
at the call of the violin, we
reached down the basket and found him
gone. Whether he had fallen out by
accident while hanging by his tall, or
taken the leap on purpose, there was no
knowing; but he had disappeared, and we
saw him no more, though a few weeks
after his departure we found his skin,
turned inside out, behind a box placed
against the wall.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Dogs Are Discriminating.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Dogs, judging from the conduct of the
generality of them, may be regarded as
indifferent to music, as they are noticed
neither to seek nor shun it, as a general
rule. Being remarkably docile, however,
they may be, and are, taught to discriminate
tunes, and to dance to violin, pipe,
and drum in a manner that indicates
plainly enough their appreciation of musical
time at least.</p>

<p class='c015'>Some dogs grind organs at the command
of their unfeeling exhibitors; and
though they always set about the business
with a serious face, that may be no
proof that they dislike music.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our own dog—a cross between a Scotch
and a Skye terrier—is affected in an extraordinary
way by the notes of the harmonium,
and chooses to post himself close
to the instrument while it is playing. So
long as the music runs below a certain
pitch all is well; but touch a single note
above that, and he prepares to join in the
performance himself.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>A Tuneful Terrier.</h3>

<p class='c017'>If a shrill note is prolonged above a
minim, he points his nose in the air, at
an angle of about forty degrees, and,
elongating his body in a straight line
from the nostrils to the tail, pitches precisely
the same note, which he will go
on sounding as long as you please. The
inference generally drawn is that he dislikes
it, and that the notes to which he
thus responds are painful to him. To us
that is not so clear, since, though the
door be open, and he has the run of the
whole house, he never shows the least
disposition to make his escape. Who
shall say that it is not a luxury to him?</p>

<p class='c015'>The point is doubtful, at least; and we
shall give him the benefit of the doubt,
and acquit him of the charge, which we
deem odious, of disrelishing music.</p>

<p class='c015'>We shall close the present sketch by a
remarkable instance of the love of music
exemplified in the conduct of a party of
mice who had obtained surreptitious admission
at a public concert. Thus it
runs:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Soon after Miss Hay had commenced
her first song, the party occupying the
front seats saw a mouse sauntering leisurely
up and down, close to the skirting of
the platform on which she was singing. As
the song proceeded, the mouse stood spellbound.
A lady tried to drive it away by
shaking her concert-bill at it; but the
little animal had lost its fear of man, and
would not retire.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Appreciative Mice.</h3>

<p class='c017'>“At the conclusion of the piece the
mouse vanished, but reappeared, bringing
with it a companion when the next song
commenced. At the end of song the second
the two mice retreated to their hole,
but made their third appearance on the
boards when the singing was again renewed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Eventually, six or seven mice came
out regularly with every song, and retired
when the music ceased. While the
melodious tones filled the apartment all
attempts to drive away the mice were
vain. These most timid members of the
animal kingdom were too fascinated to be
in terror of the human family, who actually
filled the room; and though a fiftieth
part of the means used to drive
them away would, under ordinary circumstances,
have sufficed, they now stood, or
slowly glided, so entranced by the melody
which pervaded the room that they were
heedless of the presence of their natural
enemies.</p>

<p class='c015'>“How naturalists may explain this phenomenon
we know not, nor shall we swell
this article by attempting a solution.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The paragraph concluded by giving the
names of several respectable individuals
who witnessed the singular phenomenon,
and who were willing to testify to the
truth of the report.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Discovery of America.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By</span> WASHINGTON IRVING.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='double'>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>In accordance with its policy of presenting to its readers each month
articles that have to do with the history and characteristics of the
month itself, <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span> herewith reprints the most entertaining account
that has been written of what is, without question, the most memorable
incident of the month of October—the discovery of America by Christopher
Columbus. It is from the pen of Washington Irving, the first great
man of letters produced in the New World.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the course of a period of travel in Europe, Irving went to Madrid,
Spain, in 1826. There a post as attaché of the United States Legation was
offered to him by Alexander H. Everett, then our minister to the Spanish
court. This offer was accepted. Mr. Everett suggested that Irving make a
translation from the Spanish of Navarrete’s “Voyages of Columbus.” The
suggestion appealed to Irving, but he had scarcely more than addressed
himself to his task when the idea occurred to him to write an original work
on the subject. He searched the Spanish archives for new material and
worked so zealously that in July, 1827, he was able to place the completed
manuscript in the hands of John Murray, the famous English publisher,
who brought out the work, in three volumes, in 1828.</p>

<p class='c013'>In order that the sketch here given may be the better appreciated by
persons who have allowed the earlier incidents of Columbus’s memorable
voyage to escape their memories, it may be well to say that with funds
supplied by Ferdinand and Isabella, King and Queen of Spain, Columbus
sailed from Palos, Spain, on August 3, 1492. The expedition consisted of
the Santa Maria, a decked ship, with a crew of fifty men, and commanded
by Columbus in person; and of two caravels—the Pinta, with thirty men,
commanded by Martin Pinzon, and the Niña, with twenty-four men, under
Vicente Yañez Pinzon, a brother of Martin. Columbus had the rank of
admiral. The total number of men on the three vessels was one hundred
and twenty. Owing to an accident to the rudder of the Pinta, the expedition
was compelled to put in at the Canary Islands on August 9th. On
September 6th the vessels again weighed anchor and sailed westward into
the mysterious “Ocean Sea.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The situation of Columbus was
daily becoming more and more
critical. In proportion as he
approached the regions where
he expected to find land, the
impatience of his crews augmented.
The favorable signs which increased
his confidence were derided by
them as delusive; and there was danger
of their rebelling, and obliging him to
turn back when on the point of realizing
the object of all his labors. They beheld
themselves with dismay, still wafted onward,
over the boundless wastes of what
appeared to them a mere watery desert
surrounding the habitable world.</p>

<p class='c013'>What was to become of them should
their provisions fail? Their ships were
too weak and defective even for the great
voyage they had already made, but if
they were still to press forward, adding
at every moment to the immense expanse
behind them, how should they ever be
able to return, having no intervening
port where they might victual and refit?</p>

<p class='c013'>In this way they fed each other’s discontents,
gathering together in little
knots, and fomenting a spirit of mutinous
opposition; and when we consider
the natural fire of the Spanish temperament
and its impatience of control, and
that a great part of these men were
sailing on compulsion, we cannot wonder
that there was imminent danger of
their breaking forth into open rebellion
and compelling Columbus to turn back.</p>

<p class='c013'>In their secret conferences they exclaimed
against him as a desperado, bent,
in a mad fantasy, upon doing something
extravagant to render himself notorious.
What were their sufferings and dangers
to one evidently content to sacrifice his
own life for the chance of distinction?
What obligations bound them to continue
on with him, or when were the terms of
their agreement to be considered as fulfilled?</p>

<p class='c013'>They had already penetrated unknown
seas, untraversed by a sail, far beyond
where man had ever before ventured.
They had done enough to gain themselves
a character for courage and hardihood
in undertaking such an enterprise
and persisting in it so far. How much
farther were they to go in quest of a
merely conjectured land? Were they to
sail on until they perished, or until all
return became impossible? In such case
they would be the authors of their own
destruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the other hand, should they consult
their safety, and turn back before
too late, who would blame them? Any
complaints made by Columbus would be
of no weight; he was a foreigner without
friends or influence; his schemes had
been condemned by the learned and discountenanced
by people of all ranks. He
had no party to uphold him, and a host
of opponents whose pride of opinion
would be gratified by his failure. Or, as
an effectual means of preventing his complaints,
they might throw him into the
sea, and give out that he had fallen overboard
while busy with his instruments
contemplating the stars—a report which
no one would have either the inclination
or the means to controvert.</p>

<p class='c013'>Columbus was not ignorant of the mutinous
disposition of his crew; but he
still maintained a serene and steady
countenance, soothing some with gentle
words, endeavoring to stimulate the pride
or avarice of others, and openly menacing
the refractory with signal punishment
should they do anything to impede the
voyage.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the 25th of September the wind
again became favorable, and they were
able to resume their course directly to
the west. The airs being light and the
sea calm, the vessels sailed near to each
other, and Columbus had much conversation
with Martin Alonzo Pinzon on the
subject of a chart, which the former had
sent three days before on board of the
Pinta. Pinzon thought that, according to
the indications of the map, they ought to
be in the neighborhood of Cipango and
the other islands which the admiral had
therein delineated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Columbus partly entertained the same
idea, but thought it possible that the
ships might have been borne out of their
track by the prevalent currents, or that
they had not come so far as the pilots
had reckoned. He desired that the chart
might be returned, and Pinzon, tying it
to the end of a cord, flung it on board to
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>While Columbus, his pilot, and several
of his experienced mariners were studying
the map and endeavoring to make
out from it their actual position, they
heard a shout from the Pinta, and, looking
up, beheld Martin Alonzo Pinzon
mounted on the stern of his vessel, crying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Land! land! Señor, I claim my reward!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He pointed at the same time to the
southwest, where there was indeed an
appearance of land at about twenty-five
leagues’ distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon this Columbus threw himself on
his knees and returned thanks to God;
and Martin Alonzo repeated the <i>Gloria
in Excelsis</i>, in which he was joined by his
own crew and that of the admiral.</p>

<p class='c013'>The seamen now mounted to the masthead
or climbed about the rigging, straining
their eyes in the direction pointed
out. The conviction became so general
of land in that quarter, and the joy of
the people so ungovernable, that Columbus
found it necessary to vary from his
usual course and stand all night to the
southwest.</p>

<p class='c013'>The morning light, however, put an end
to all their hopes, as to a dream. The
fancied land proved to be nothing but an
evening cloud, and had vanished in the
night. With dejected hearts they once
more resumed their western course, from
which Columbus would never have varied
but in compliance with their clamorous
wishes.</p>

<p class='c013'>For several days they continued on
with the same propitious breeze, tranquil
sea, and mild, delightful weather. The
water was so calm that the sailors
amused themselves with swimming about
the vessel. Dolphins began to abound,
and flying fish, darting into the air, fell
upon the decks. The continued signs of
land diverted the attention of the crews
and insensibly beguiled them onward.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the 1st of October, according to the
reckoning of the pilot of the admiral’s
ship, they had come five hundred and
eighty leagues west since leaving the
Canary Islands. The reckoning which
Columbus showed the crew was five hundred
and eighty-four, but the reckoning
which he kept privately was seven hundred
and seven. On the following day the
weeds floated from east to west, and on
the third day no birds were to be seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crews now began to fear that they
had passed between islands, from one to
the other of which the birds had been
flying. Columbus had also some doubts
of the kind, but refused to alter his westward
course. The people again uttered
murmurs and menaces, but on the following
day they were visited by such
flights of birds, and the various indications
of land became so numerous, that
from a state of despondency they passed
to one of confident expectation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Eager to obtain the promised pension,
the seamen were continually giving the
cry of land, on the least appearance of
the kind. To put a stop to these false
alarms, which produced continual disappointment,
Columbus declared that
should any one give such notice, and land
not be discovered within three days afterward,
he should thenceforth forfeit all
claim to the reward.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the evening of the 6th of October
Martin Alonzo Pinzon began to lose confidence
in their present course, and proposed
that they should stand more to
the southward. Columbus, however, still
persisted in steering directly west. Observing
this difference of opinion in a
person so important in his squadron as
Pinzon, and fearing that chance or design
might scatter the ships, he ordered that,
should either of the caravels be separated
from him, it should stand to the
west, and endeavor as soon as possible
to join company again. He directed, also,
that the vessels should keep near to him
at sunrise and sunset, as at these times
the state of the atmosphere is most
favorable to the discovery of distant
land.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the morning of the 7th of October,
at sunrise, several of the admiral’s crew
thought they beheld land away to the
west, but so indistinctly that no one
ventured to proclaim it, lest he should
be mistaken, and forfeit all chance of
the reward: the Niña, however, being a
good sailor, pressed forward to ascertain
the fact.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a little while a flag was hoisted at
her masthead, and a gun discharged,
being the preconcerted signals for land.
New joy was awakened throughout the
little squadron, and every eye was turned
to the west. As they advanced, however,
their cloud-built hopes faded away, and
before evening the fancied land had
again melted into air.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crews now sank into a degree of
dejection proportioned to their recent excitement;
but new circumstances occurred
to arouse them. Columbus, having observed
great flights of small field-birds
going toward the southwest, concluded
they must be secure of some neighboring
land, where they would find food and
a resting-place. He knew the importance
which the Portuguese voyagers attached
to the flight of birds, by following which
they had discovered most of their islands.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had now come seven hundred and
fifty leagues, the distance at which he
had computed to find the island of
Cipango; as there was no appearance of
it, he might have missed it through some
mistake in the latitude. He determined,
therefore, on the evening of the 7th of
October, to alter his course to the west-southwest—the
direction in which the
birds generally flew—and continue that
direction for at least two days.</p>

<p class='c013'>After all, it was no great deviation
from his main course, and would meet
the wishes of the Pinzons, as well as be
inspiriting to his followers generally.</p>

<p class='c013'>For three days they stood in this direction,
and the farther they went the
more frequent and encouraging were the
signs of land. Flights of small birds of
various colors, some of them such as sing
in the fields, came flying about the ships,
and then continued toward the southwest,
and others were heard also flying by in
the night. Tunny fish played about the
smooth sea, and a heron, a pelican, and
a duck were seen, all bound in the same
direction. The herbage which floated by
was fresh and green, as if recently from
land, and the air, Columbus observed,
was as sweet and fragrant as April
breezes in Seville.</p>

<p class='c013'>All these, however, were regarded by
the crews as so many delusions beguiling
them on to destruction; and when on the
evening of the third day they beheld the
sun go down upon a shoreless ocean,
they broke forth into turbulent clamor.
They exclaimed against this obstinacy in
tempting fate by continuing on into a
boundless sea. They insisted upon turning
homeward and abandoning the voyage
as hopeless.</p>

<p class='c013'>Columbus endeavored to pacify them
by gentle words and promises of large
rewards; but finding that they only increased
in clamor, he assumed a decided
tone. He told them that it was useless
to murmur; the expedition had been sent
by the sovereigns to seek the Indies, and,
happen what might, he was determined
to persevere until, by the blessing of God,
he should accomplish the enterprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Columbus was now at open defiance
with his crew, and his situation became
desperate. Fortunately the manifestations
of the vicinity of land were such
on the following day as no longer to
admit a doubt. Besides a quantity of
fresh weeds, such as grow in rivers, they
saw a green fish of a kind which keeps
about rocks; then a branch of thorn
with berries on it, and recently separated
from the tree, floated by them; then they
picked up a reed, a small board, and,
above all, a staff artificially carved.</p>

<p class='c013'>All gloom and mutiny now gave way to
sanguine expectation, and throughout the
day each one was eagerly on the watch,
in hopes of being the first to discover
the long-sought-for land.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the evening, when, according to invariable
custom on board of the admiral’s
ship, the mariners had sung the <cite>Salve
Regina</cite>, or vesper hymn to the Virgin, he
made an impressive address to his crew.
He pointed out the goodness of God in
thus conducting them by soft and favoring
breezes across a tranquil ocean,
cheering their hopes continually with
fresh signs, increasing as their fears augmented,
and thus leading and guiding
them to a promised land.</p>

<p class='c013'>He now reminded them of the orders
he had given on leaving the Canaries—that,
after sailing westward seven hundred
leagues, they should not make sail
after midnight. Present appearances authorized
such a precaution. He thought
it probable they would make land that
very night; he ordered, therefore, a vigilant
lookout to be kept from the forecastle,
promising to whomsoever should
make the discovery a doublet of velvet
in addition to the pension to be given by
the sovereigns.</p>

<p class='c013'>The breeze had been fresh all day,
with more sea than usual, and they had
made great progress. At sunset they
had stood again to the west, and were
plowing the waves at a rapid rate, the
Pinta keeping the lead, from her superior
sailing. The greatest animation prevailed
throughout the ships; not an eye
was closed that night.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the evening darkened, Columbus
took his station on the top of the castle
or cabin on the high poop of his vessel,
ranging his eye along the dusky horizon,
and maintaining an intense and unremitting
watch. About ten o’clock he
thought he beheld a light glimmering
at a great distance. Fearing his eager
hopes might deceive him, he called to
Pedro Gutierrez, gentleman of the king’s
bedchamber, and inquired whether he
saw such a light; the latter replied in
the affirmative.</p>

<p class='c013'>Doubtful whether it might not yet be
some delusion of the fancy, Columbus
called Rodrigo Sanchez, of Segovia, and
made the same inquiry. By the time the
latter had ascended the round-house the
light had disappeared. They saw it
once or twice afterward in sudden and
passing gleams—as if it were a torch in
the bark of a fisherman, rising and sinking
with the waves, or in the hand of
some person on shore borne up and down
as he walked from house to house.</p>

<p class='c013'>So transient and uncertain were these
gleams that few attached any importance
to them; Columbus, however, considered
them as certain signs of land, and, moreover,
that the land was inhabited.</p>

<p class='c013'>They continued their course until two
in the morning, when a gun from the
Pinta gave the joyous signal of land. It
was first descried by a mariner named
Rodrigo de Triana; but the reward was
afterward adjudged to the admiral for
having previously perceived the light.</p>

<p class='c013'>The land was now clearly seen about
two leagues distant, whereupon they took
in sail and laid to, waiting impatiently
for the dawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thoughts and feelings of Columbus
In this little space of time must have
been tumultuous and intense. At length,
in spite of every difficulty and danger,
he had accomplished his object. The
great mystery of the ocean was revealed;
his theory, which had been the scoff of
sages, was triumphantly established; he
had secured to himself a glory durable
as the world itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is difficult to conceive the feelings
of such a man at such a moment, or the
conjectures which must have thronged
upon his mind as to the land before him,
covered with darkness. That it was fruitful
was evident from the vegetables which
floated from its shores.</p>

<p class='c013'>He thought, too, that he perceived the
fragrance of aromatic groves. The moving
light he had beheld proved it to be
the residence of man. But what were its
inhabitants? Were they like those of the
other parts of the globe, or were they
some strange and monstrous race, such
as the imagination was prone in those
times to give to all remote and unknown
regions? Had he come upon some wild
island far in the Indian Sea, or was this
the famed Cipango itself, the object of
his golden fancies?</p>

<p class='c013'>A thousand speculations of the kind
must have swarmed upon him, as, with
his anxious crews, he waited for the
night to pass away; wondering whether
the morning light would reveal a savage
wilderness, or dawn upon spicy groves,
and glittering fanes, and gilded cities,
and all the splendors of Oriental civilization.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ORIGIN OF POPULAR GAMES.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Dice-Shaking, Chess, and Polo Rank As Patriarchs, While Ping-Pong and Basket-Ball May be Said to Be Only Fledgelings Just Out of the Incubator—Football Was Taken to England by the Romans.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Few nations are able to boast of such
a great variety of games as are
played in Great Britain and the
United States. In many cases the Anglo-Saxon
has been responsible for the
preservation of games which are now almost
unknown in the countries in which
they had their origin. Some of these
forms of diversion are older than the
Roman Empire, while others, like ping-pong
and basket-ball, are of recent invention.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>BASEBALL</b> holds undisputed sway as
the American national game. It is founded
on the old English game of rounders, and
for almost a century it has been known
in the Eastern States in various forms.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>BASKET-BALL</b> is unique, inasmuch as
it was the invention of one man, and was
completed at a single sitting. In 1891, in
the course of a lecture at the Young
Men’s Christian Association in Plainfield,
Massachusetts, the lecturer spoke of the
mental processes of invention, and used
a game, with its limitations and necessities,
as an illustration. James Naismith,
who was a member of the class, worked
out basket-ball that same night as an
ideal game to meet the case. It was presented
the next day in the lecture-room
and put in practise with the aid of the
members of the gymnasium. From there
it spread to other branches of the Young
Men’s Christian Association and subsequently
to athletic clubs and the general
public.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>BILLIARDS</b> is believed by some to have
been brought from the East by the Crusaders,
while others claim an English
origin for it and find it allied to the game
of bowls. Still others assert that the
French developed it from an ancient
German game. It seems pretty certain
that the first person to give form and
rule to the game was an artist, named
Henrique Devigne, who lived in the reign
of Charles IX. One writer sees in billiards
the ancient game of paille-maille
played on a table instead of on the
ground, and this is indeed a very reasonable
assumption.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>BOWLS</b>, or bowling, is one of the most
popular and ancient of English pastimes,
its origin being traceable to the twelfth
century. It was held in such disfavor
for years that laws were enacted against
it and it was an illegal pursuit. Alleys
were built, however, as it could not be
played out-of-doors during the winter,
and the game flourished in spite of opposition.
In the beginning of the eighteenth
century greens began to increase, while
the alleys were rigorously and absolutely
suppressed. It soon became a royal
game, and no gentleman’s place was
complete without a bowling-green.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>CHECKERS</b> is said by some to be a very
old game, while others declare it to be
of comparatively modern origin. Whence
it came is absolutely unknown. The
game is also called draughts, and there
are many varieties of it—Chinese, English,
Polish, Spanish, Italian, and Turkish.
It is also found among the native
tribes of the interior of New Zealand.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>CHESS</b> always has been the subject of
more dispute, so far as its origin is concerned,
than any other game. It is probably
the most ancient as well as the
most intellectual of games, and it is
played all over the world. The belief
which is most generally accepted is that
it came from the Hindoos, and the most
conservative estimate places its age at
one thousand years. Some persons, however,
claim an age of from four to five
thousand years for it. Its basis is the art
of war, and the Hindoo name for it,
<i>chaturanga</i>, means the four “angas” or
members of an army which are given in
Hindoo writings as elephants, horses,
chariots, and foot-soldiers.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>CRICKET</b> is the national game of Englishmen,
and seems always to have been
played in Britain. The first mention of
it is found in a manuscript of the thirteenth
century. The name comes from
the Saxon <i>cric</i> or <i>cryc</i>, a crooked stick—an
obvious reference to the bat with
which it is played. Wherever the English
have colonized, the game is played,
and in many of the British possessions
it has become popular with the natives,
notably in New Zealand.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>CROQUET</b> is said to have been derived
from paille-maille, or mall, which was
played in Languedoc in the thirteenth
century. Mall was very popular in England
at the time of the Stuarts. No other
game has had such fluctuations of fortune
as croquet, as it sunk into oblivion
by the end of the eighteenth century, yet
was revived during the middle of the
nineteenth, and assumed almost the popularity
of a national game.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>CURLING</b> has been popular in North
Britain for the last three centuries, and
is regarded as a Scottish game. It is
possible that some of the Flemish merchants
brought it into the country toward
the close of the sixteenth century, but
however that may be, it owes its development
to the Scotch, and is now decidedly
the national game of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>DICE</b> are said by some to have had
their origin in occult sources, but more
reasonably they are ascribed to Psalmedes,
of Greece, <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 1244. Those exhumed
at Thebes are identical with those
used to-day, and the games played with
them are the simplest and most widely
known games of chance in the world.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>FOOTBALL</b> was undoubtedly introduced
into England by the Romans, and
is, therefore, older than the national
game of cricket. Varieties of it may be
found in many parts of the world. It is
known in the Philippines and through
the Polynesian Islands, among the Eskimos,
the Faroe Islands, and even by the
Maoris of New Zealand. The Greeks
also played it.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>GOLF</b> is popularly supposed to have its
origin In Scotland, but there seems to be
good reason for believing that it came
from Holland. The name itself is undoubtedly
of German or Dutch extraction,
and an enactment of James I of
England, bearing date 1618, refers to a
considerable importation of golf-balls
from Holland, and at the same time
places a restriction upon this extravagant
use, in a foreign country, of the
coin of the realm.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>LACROSSE</b> is the national ball-game of
Canada. It came from the aboriginal red
men, who doubtless played it for many
centuries before the discovery of the
New World. Different tribes played it in
different ways, and it was usually very
rough. The name was given to it by the
French Canadians, who saw the resemblance
between the curved netted stick
used in playing it and a bishop’s crozier
or <i>crosse</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>PING-PONG</b> is really table-tennis, and
had its origin in that game. Its immense
popularity lasted only a brief space of
time, and its greatest vogue was in
France and America.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>POKER</b> is probably a development of
<i>il frusso</i>, an Italian game of the fifteenth
century. A similar game called <i>primiera</i>
was played in Italy in the sixteenth century,
and thence journeyed into Spain.
In France this became <i>ambigu</i>, and later
appeared in England under the name of
brag. Poker is distinctly an American
game, and seems to have descended more
directly from the game of brag than from
any of the others.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>POLO</b> is of Eastern origin, and has been
a favorite pastime in Persia, Tatary,
and the frontiers of India from prehistoric
times. The name of the game
varies with the district, and the rules are
not the same on minor points, though
they are substantially alike on the main
issues. China and Japan also have a
game closely resembling the Persian
sport.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>POOL AND PYRAMIDS</b> are both a
form of billiards, and their origin from
the same source is apparent.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>SHUFFLEBOARD</b> probably comes from
the same source as quoits, curling, and
bowling. It was immensely popular in
England during the reign of Henry VIII.
Subsequently it was one of the games
forbidden by law because it turned the
people from the practise of archery.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>TENNIS</b> is pronounced the oldest of all
the existing ball-games. It is impossible
to give its origin, but it was played in
Europe during the Middle Ages, in the
parks or ditches of the feudal castles.
It was at first the pastime of kings and
nobles, but later it grew popular with
all classes. The French took it from
the Italians and the English from the
French.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>WHIST</b> undoubtedly is derived from the
old game of trumps, which has a purely
English lineage. There is no record of
the origin of this game nor of its development
into ruff-and-honors, which was
the parent of whist. The earliest reference
to it is believed to be in a sermon
of Latimer’s, about the year 1529. The
name probably is derived from the “hist”
or “silence” which close attention to
play demands of the players.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Ten weeks after the production of
“Rienzi,” the Dresden Theater produced
Wagner’s new opera, “The Flying Dutchman,”
which had been composed in seven
weeks after the completion of “Rienzi.”
Much to the surprise of Wagner and his
friends, “The Flying Dutchman” met
with a cold reception, and served to slam
shut in Wagner’s face the door of popularity
which “Rienzi” had opened. The
work was inadequately staged and sung;
but a more effective cause of its failure
lay in the fact that it was a new kind of
opera, whose method the public did not
understand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Wagner had begun to apply his theory
of leading motives, or reminiscent melodies.
These motives are phrases of a
few notes rendered by the orchestra,
each of which symbolizes a character, a
psychological mood, or an event of dramatic
weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>While listening to the story which the
orchestra is telling, one may without
difficulty foretell the entrance of a character,
the approach of doom, or the fateful
result of an action. From these
motives, modulated through strange keys
and sung by instruments of differing
colors, the scores of Wagner’s late operas,
from “Die Meistersinger” on, were in
their entirety composed.</p>

</div>

<div  class='c006'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='large'><span class='blackletter'>Wagner.</span></span></div>

<p class='c013'>Wagner received his
idea for “The Flying
Dutchman” from a dramatic episode in
his own life. At the time of the production
of his opera, “The Novice of
Palermo,” he was living beyond his
means in Russia, in the town of Riga.</p>

<p class='c013'>The failure of his opera left him heavily
in debt, and the importunities of creditors
decided him to escape in disguise from
Russian territory. Minna, his wife, masqueraded
as the wife of a lumberman, who
took her as far as Pillau, in north
Prussia, to which place Wagner was
assisted by a different route. From that
seaport he embarked with his wife, an
opera and a half, a diminutive purse,
and a Newfoundland dog, on a sailing-vessel
to London, and thence to Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before leaving Riga, Wagner had read
the legend of the Flying Dutchman, who
was condemned to sail forever till the
love of a faithful woman should release
him from this curse. Among the wild
storms of Wagner’s own voyage, in the
wild romance of the passage through
Northern fiords, he became obsessed by
the story.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps it was not only the charm of
the music of the sea and the lilt of the
sailor’s songs which inspired him, but
also his own heart’s craving for a cessation
from wandering, and a home blessed
by peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the curtain
rises we gaze on a
wide storm-tossed ocean; the ship of the
Norwegian mariner, <i>Daland</i>, lies at anchor
near shore. Presently the sails of the
<i>Flying Dutchman’s</i> vessel emerge, blood-red,
from the blackness of the storm.
The <i>Dutchman</i> steps ashore, for another
term of seven years is past, and he is free
to seek once more on earth the love of
a faithful woman, whose devotion shall
save him from the curse of wandering.</p>

<p class='c013'>When <i>Daland</i> reappears on deck he
sees the <i>Dutchman</i> and greets him, although
he is a stranger, with open-hearted
cordiality. The <i>Dutchman</i> begs
asylum for a few days in <i>Daland’s</i> home,
a few miles away, offering <i>Daland</i> in return
a share of the treasures he has
amassed. To this <i>Daland</i> consents.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you a daughter?” asks the
<i>Dutchman</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A beautiful daughter named Senta,”
<i>Daland</i> answers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, with the precipitancy characteristic
of all Wagner’s lovers, the <i>Dutchman</i>
cries:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let her be my wife!”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Daland</i>, gazing on the treasures which
the <i>Dutchman</i> has shown him, joyously
gives his permission.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second act shows us a room in
<i>Daland’s</i> house, where <i>Senta’s</i> friends are
sitting before wheels, gaily singing and
spinning. <i>Senta</i> herself sits apart, gazing
sentimentally at a portrait over the door—the
portrait of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gay song of her friends irritates
her, and she bids them cease.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then sing us a better song yourself!”
they cry.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Senta</i> accepts the challenge, and sings
the ballad of “The Flying Dutchman.”
At its close she jumps up and cries that
she will be the woman to save the suffering
mariner.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few minutes later <i>Daland</i> enters, accompanied
by the <i>Dutchman</i>. <i>Senta’s</i>
eyes leap away from her father to the
man beside him. Speechless and immobile
she stares at the face of her dreams.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Father, who is this stranger?” she
breathes.</p>

<p class='c013'>And <i>Daland</i> whispers that he is a rich
mariner who has come to woo her, and
whom she must favor.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Daland</i> then leaves them alone. For
long moments they stare at each other,
while the passion of love for the first
time fills the <i>Dutchman’s</i> heart, and <i>Senta</i>
sees her fancies take form in reality.</p>

<p class='c013'>When <i>Daland</i> returns, <i>Senta</i> has plighted
her faith in the arms of her long-desired
lover.</p>

<p class='c013'>The third act presents the sea again.
Two ships lie at anchor. That of <i>Daland</i>,
which is gay with lights and movement,
and the fantom ship of the <i>Dutchman</i>,
dark and silent. Suddenly the sea, calm
elsewhere, begins to rise about the ship
of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tongues of light shriek about its masts,
a storm howls, the crew appears, and in
satanic strains taunt the captain because
he has not even yet found a faithful
woman. Then suddenly the sea subsides,
and darkness and silence again cover the
ship.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Senta</i> comes out of the door of her
house, accompanied by a suitor, Erik.
<i>Erik</i> pleads with her not to marry the
<i>Dutchman</i>, but to renew that affection for
himself which she must, he says, formerly
have felt. He reminds her of an occasion
when she stood, her arm about his
neck, her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c013'>The <i>Dutchman</i> has drawn near, quite
unperceived by either one of them, and
has heard this tale. Ignorant of <i>Senta’s</i>
passion for himself, and now believing
her to be but a mere flirt, he
rushes forward, crying, “Farewell, Senta!”
Then, pointing to the anchored
ship, whose blood-red sails are being
hoisted, he cries:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am the Flying Dutchman!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As he leaps on board, the vessel
moves out of the harbor. <i>Senta</i> runs to
a rock, from which she plunges after her
lover into the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>As she does so, the curse is lifted, the
fantom ship falls apart, and <i>Senta</i> and the
<i>Flying Dutchman</i> together arise transfigured
from the waves.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The Swiss constitute that curious
anomaly, a nation without a
language, and in this they are alone
among all the peoples of the world.
This is all the more remarkable when
their intense patriotism is considered,
and their really wonderful love of country.</p>

<p class='c013'>The official languages are German,
French, and Italian, these three being
the recognized “mother-tongue” of the
majority of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c014'>About three-fourths of the people speak
German, while the remainder divide four
other languages among them—mainly
French and Italian—the languages varying,
as a rule, according to the proximity
of the people to each country whose
tongue they speak.</p>

<p class='c015'>Public documents and notices are printed
in both the French and German languages.
In the Swiss National Parliament
the members make their speeches
either in French or German, for nearly all
the members understand both these languages.</p>

    <div>Strange Persistence in Nature of These Mystic Numbers, Each of Which Has Ever Been Regarded as Deeply Significant by the Various Races at Different Periods of History, and Especially in Religious Observance.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Superstition of some sort or other
has been attached to certain numbers
from time immemorial, but
the numbers three, seven, and thirteen
have been particularly favored, and
three and seven have figured very prominently
in mythology, scriptural history,
and elsewhere. Three is called the
perfect number, seven is regarded as
lucky, and thirteen as unlucky.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Pythagoras who termed three
the “perfect number,” because it expressed
“the beginning, the middle, and
the end,” signifying a perfect whole.</p>

<p class='c013'>On this account he made it a symbol of
the Deity, and the “Holy Trinity” is now,
and doubtless will be always, the most
potent symbol of Christianity. The world
was supposed to be under the rule of three
gods: Jupiter (heaven), Neptune (sea),
and Pluto (Hades). Jove is represented
carrying three-forked lightning. Neptune
carries a trident, and Pluto is accompanied
by a three-headed dog.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Divides Things Into Three Parts.</h3>

<p class='c018'>There are three Fates, three Furies, and
three Graces. The Harpies are three in
number; there are three Sibylline books,
and the fountain in Mysia, from which
Hylas drew water, was presided over by
three nymphs. The pythoness sat on a
tripod; the Muses are three times three.
Both Man and the World are threefold—the
former, body, soul, and spirit; the
latter, earth, sea, and air. The enemies
of Man are the world, the flesh, and the
devil; the kingdoms of Nature are animal,
vegetable, and mineral. The cardinal
colors are red, yellow, and blue.</p>

<p class='c013'>In almost all countries new laws have
to pass three bodies. In the United States,
State laws pass the Assembly, the State
Senate, and the Governor. Federal laws
pass the House of Representatives, the
Senate, and the President. In England
there are the Commons, the Lords, and
the King to be reckoned with.</p>

<p class='c013'>Concerning the church there were the
“Three Chapters,” otherwise three books
on the subject of the Incarnation and the
two natures of Christ, which caused a
great controversy during the reign of
Justinian and the popedom of Vigilius.
In 553 these books were condemned by
the General Council at Constantinople.
One was written by Theodore, of Mopsuestia;
one by Theodoret, of Cyprus; and
the third by Ibas, Bishop of Edessa.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the “three bishoprics” of France
that passed to the German rule after the
Franco-Prussian War. They were Metz,
Verdun, and Lorraine, each of which was
once under the lordship of a bishop. In
early days the churches were usually provided
with what was known as a “three
decker.” This structure consisted of the
clerk’s desk, the reading-desk, and the
pulpit, one above the other. Then again,
Epiphany or Twelfth Day is sometimes
known as “Three Kings’ Day,” as it is
supposed to commemorate the visit of the
three kings, or wise men, to the infant
Jesus.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three estates of the realm are the
nobility, the clergy, and the commonalty
in England, the sovereign being in a class
by himself. One of the collects in the
English prayer-books thanks God for preserving
“the king and the three estates
of the realm.” It was Burke who designated
the press of the country “the fourth
estate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mention must also be made of the
“three R’s” of education: reading, ’riting,
and ’rithmetic; and the Bible is composed
of three parts: Old Testament, New Testament,
and Apocrypha.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>The Holiness of Seven.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Seven always has been a holy number,
and that may be why it is considered
lucky. The creation occupied seven days;
there are seven spirits before the throne
of God. There are seven days in the
week; seven divisions of the Lord’s
Prayer; seven ages in the life of man;
and the just are supposed to fall “seven
times a day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The moon has seven phases, every seventh
year was sabbatical for the Jews,
and seven times seven years was the
“jubilee.” The three great feasts of the
Jews lasted seven days, and seven weeks
elapsed between the first and the second
of these.</p>

<p class='c013'>Levitical purifications lasted seven
days. In the Bible are mentioned seven
candlesticks, seven trumpets, seven stars,
and seven horns. The Lamb had seven
eyes. Ten times seven Israelites went
into Egypt, and the exile lasted ten times
seven years. There were ten times seven
elders, and Pharaoh, in his dream, saw
seven ears of corn and seven kine.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bibles or sacred books of the world
are seven in number: the Bible of the
Christians; the Eddas of the Scandinavians;
the Five Kings of the Chinese;
the Koran of the Mohammedans; the Tri
Pitikes of the Buddhists; the three Vedas
of the Hindus; and the Zendavesta of the
Persians. Incidentally, the Koran dates
from the seventh century.</p>

<p class='c013'>The seven churches of Asia were
founded in the following cities: Ephesus,
Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis,
Philadelphia, and Laodicea. Strangely
enough, each of these churches, which
were founded by the Apostles themselves,
are now Mohammedan, and the cities in
which they stand, with the exception of
Smyrna, are more or less insignificant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the throne of God stand seven
angels. They are Michael, Gabriel, Lamael,
Raphael, Zachariel, Anael, and
Oriphel. The Deity is endowed with
seven spirits: the Spirit of Wisdom, the
Spirit of Understanding, the Spirit of
Counsel, the Spirit of Power, the Spirit of
Righteousness, the Spirit of Knowledge,
and the Spirit of Divine Awfulness.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the life of the Virgin Mary there
were Seven Joys and Seven Sorrows.
The former were the Annunciation, the
Visitation, the Nativity, the Adoration of
the Magi, the Presentation in the Temple,
the finding of Christ among the Doctors,
and the Assumption. The sorrows were:
Simeon’s Prophecy, the Flight into Egypt,
the unexplained absence of Christ, the
Betrayal, the Crucifixion, the Descent
from the Cross, and the Ascension, when
Mary was left alone. In the picture
“Our Lady of Dolors” she is represented
with her breast pierced with seven
swords emblematic of her seven sorrows.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Seven Men Who Did Wonders In Chivalry.</h3>

<p class='c018'>The Seven Champions of Christendom
were: St. George, of England, who was
imprisoned seven years; St. Denys, of
France, who lived seven years in the form
of a hart; St. James, of Spain, who was
dumb for seven years out of love for a
Jewess; St. Anthony, of Italy, who was
released from his enchanted sleep by St.
George’s sons, who quenched seven
lamps; St Andrew, of Scotland, who delivered
six ladies who had lived seven
years as white swans; St. David, of Wales,
who was released from a seven years’
enchanted sleep by St. George; and St.
Patrick, of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Seven Sages of Greece and their
mottoes were: Solon, of Athens: “Know
thyself.” Chilo, of Sparta: “Consider the
end.” Thales, of Miletos: “Who hateth
suretyship is sure.” Bias, of Priene:
“Most men are bad.” Cleobulos, of Lindos:
“The golden mean,” or “Avoid extremes.”
Pittacos, of Mitylene: “Seize
time by the forelock.” And Periander, of
Corinth: “Nothing is impossible to industry.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>How the Old Alchemists Relied on Seven.</h3>

<p class='c018'>There are seven bodies in alchemy, each
having its planet. They are: gold, the
sun; silver, the moon; iron, Mars; quicksilver,
Mercury; lead, Saturn; tin, Jupiter;
and copper, Venus.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Seven Deadly Sins are pride,
wrath, envy, lust, gluttony, avarice, and
sloth; while the Seven Virtues are faith,
hope, charity, prudence, justice, fortitude,
and temperance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ancient teaching had it that the soul of
a man was composed of seven properties,
each under the influence of a planet,
thus: fire animates, earth gives the sense
of feeling, speech is gained from water,
air gives taste, sight comes from mist,
flowers give hearing, and the south wind
gives smelling. Here are the seven
senses, and then, too, as the boys at
school are fond of saying, there are seven
holes in one’s head: two ears, two eyes,
two nostrils, and the mouth.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Seven Sleepers were seven youths
of Ephesus who fled from persecution to
a cave and slept therein for many years.
Their names were Constantine, Dionysius,
John, Maximian, Malchus, Martinian, and
Serapion.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are two groups of Seven Wonders
of the World. The antique group consisted
of the Pyramids, Babylon’s Hanging
Gardens, Mausolus’s Tomb, the Temple
of Diana at Ephesus, the Colossus of
Rhodes, Jupiter’s Statue by Phidias, the
Pharos of Egypt, and the Palace of Cyrus
(which was cemented with gold).</p>

<p class='c013'>The seven wonders of the Middle Ages
were the Colosseum, the Catacombs at Alexandria,
the Great Wall of China, Stonehenge,
the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the
Porcelain Tower of Nankin, and the
Mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>The Origin of “Unlucky Thirteen.”</h3>

<p class='c018'>Thirteen is regarded as unlucky by a
great many people who claim that they
are not superstitious about other things,
and there are thousands of tales of unfortunate
occurrences supposedly due to
that number.</p>

<p class='c013'>The origin of the superstition is very
generally supposed to be the “Last Supper,”
at which the Lord and His Twelve
Apostles were present. As a matter of
history, the belief in the “hoodoo” antedates
Christianity by centuries. Norse
mythology deemed it unlucky to sit down
thirteen at a banquet table, because at
such a feast in the Valhalla, Loki, the
spirit of evil and the god of strife, once
intruded. Balder, the god of peace, was
killed by the blind war-god Hoder, at the
instigation of Loki.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Turks so dislike the number that
the word indicating it has become almost
expurged from their vocabulary. The
Italians never use it in making up their
lotteries, and in Paris no house bears the
number; and there is in existence there
a profession the members of which make
their living attending dinner parties in
order to make the fourteenth at table.</p>

<p class='c013'>At a discussion of superstitions recently
one young man ventured the remark that
he knew of hundreds of buildings in New
York that had no thirteenth story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How is that?” he was asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They are only twelve stories high,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nevertheless, there are several skyscrapers
in the metropolis in which the
number thirteen is skipped both in numbering
the floors and in numbering the
rooms. The Kuhn-Loeb Building, at the
corner of Pine and William Streets, is an
example, and the building at the corner
of William and Wall Streets has a twelfth
floor and a fourteenth floor, but no floor
in between.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE STORY OF THE KILKENNY CATS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Hessian Soldiers, Stationed in Ireland, Were Responsible for One of the Most Desperate Battles in History.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>For more than a century the Kilkenny
cats, which “fought until
there was nothing left of them but
their tails,” have been regarded as the
most quarrelsome creatures of which
there is any record.</p>

<p class='c013'>Various accounts of their memorable
encounter have appeared from time to
time, but the version which is given the
most credence is that offered by a writer
in the <cite>Irish Nation</cite>. This story is as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>The story has been so long current
that it has become a proverb—“as quarrelsome
as the Kilkenny cats”; two of
the cats in which city are asserted to
have fought so long and so ferociously
that naught was found of them but their
tails.</p>

<p class='c015'>The facts are these: During the rebellion
which occurred in Ireland in 1798,
Kilkenny was garrisoned by a regiment
of Hessian soldiers, whose custom it was
to tie together, in one of their barrack-rooms,
two cats by their respective tails,
and then throw them face to face across
a line generally used for drying clothes.
The cats naturally became infuriated,
and scratched each other in the abdomen
until death ensued to one or both of them.</p>

<p class='c015'>The officers were made acquainted with
the barbarous acts of cruelty, and resolved
to put an end to them. For this
purpose an officer was ordered to inspect
each barrack-room daily and report its
state. The soldiers, determined not to
lose the daily torture of the cats, generally
employed one of their comrades
to watch the approach of their officer.</p>

<p class='c015'>On one occasion he neglected his duty,
and the officer was heard ascending the
stairs while the cats were undergoing
their customary torture. One of the
troopers seized a sword from the armrack
and with a single blow divided the
tails of the cats.</p>

<p class='c015'>The cats escaped through the open
windows of the room, which was entered
instantly afterward by the officer, who
inquired what was the cause of the two
bleeding cat’s tails being suspended on
the line, and was told in reply that “two
cats had been fighting in the room; that
it was found impossible to separate them,
and they fought so desperately that they
had devoured each other up, with the exception
of their two tails.”</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Of the gems reprinted in <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>, our
readers have received none more gladly than
Mrs. Susan Marr Spalding’s “Fate,” which
appeared in our first issue. Her name was
then given as “Spaulding,” an error which
we take this occasion to correct.</p>

<p class='c013'>Few who read the poem in the March
<span class='sc'>Scrap Book</span> were aware that Mrs. Spalding
was still living. It is many years since
“Fate” first appeared. The author’s fame,
while amply justified by many other poems, has been permitted to
rest upon that single earlier product, and the author herself has
been lost sight of. Since “Fate” appeared, however, she has
written much that is worthy of long remembrance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Spalding has been living with a friend, Mrs. Louise P.
Sargent, of West Medford, Massachusetts, who writes of her, saying:
“She is a helpless invalid, but so sweet and helpful that her
influence radiates through a large circle.” Many friends sent her
the March <span class='sc'>Scrap Book</span>, and she said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am growing tired of ‘Fate.’ Why don’t they copy some of
the sonnets, which are surely as deserving?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Spalding’s later poems, while perhaps no one of them
strikes so vital a tone as “Fate,” are of high merit. We reprint
from “The Wings of Icarus,” published by Roberts Brothers in
1892, the following fine sonnet:</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Van Nesten and the Burglar.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By</span> W. S. ROGERS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The wind blew and blew. It
flapped across the river and
disported itself up through the
town, shaking and tearing at
things—gates, chimneys, and
wire-hung smokestacks. It shrieked and
roared through alleys and around corners,
and at last it careened up Main
Street, on the very stroke of midnight.
There it contended with an uncertain-minded
person, whom it found trying to
navigate.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was Mr. Chester Van Nesten,
and he was supposed (by himself only,
for no one else on earth knew anything
at all about it) to be going somewhere.
Not home, however, for Mr. Van Nesten
was opposed to going home in dark and
windy weather at twelve o’clock at night.
“M’ dear,” he had said impressively
when he thought of home, “lodge
meet’n—in-itiation—unfit s’ciety la’ies!”
And that, several times repeated, seemed
to clinch the argument.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having formed a resolution not to go
to his home until such time as the
streets and buildings, which whirled
about him so erratically, should find
themselves once more in their proper
positions, he decided to go to his office
and there spend the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length, after a series of wonderful
tacks, he succeeded in steering up to the
darkened building in which were situated
the offices of the firm of Hidgepit
&#38; Van Nesten.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pausing before the stairway entrance
of the old building, Mr. Van Nesten
rattled at the door-knob.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Locked!” he muttered as he fumbled
uncertainly in his pockets.</p>

<p class='c013'>The keys were forthcoming in due
time, and then, in a spasmodic manner,
he applied himself to the task of opening
the door. He succeeded. Then,
closing the door after him, he slouched
and stumbled along till he encountered
a staircase. Mr. Van Nesten paused to
rest and consider this staircase, and then,
breathing very hard, he clutched an invisible
bannister and began by painful
degrees to ascend.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hidgepit &#38; Van Nesten’s office was
on the second floor, near the center of
the building. Hidgepit &#38; Van Nesten’s
composing-room being in front and
Hidgepit &#38; Van Nesten’s bindery in the
rear. Mr. Van Nesten arrived at last
at the office. He stumbled in and endeavored
to light the gas. But he had
no matches—none—and after solemnly
expressing appreciation of this mystery,
he groped about in the dark for a time,
thumping himself uncertainly against
things, till he found a certain small
leather-covered couch or lounge that reposed
in a corner of the room with its
head against a big iron safe. Mr. Van
Nesten, breathing audible relief, sat
down to rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>His father-in-law and senior partner,
Mr. Hidgepit, owned this lounge, and
was in the habit of reclining on it daily
(Sundays excepted) after lunch, while
he meditated and encouraged digestion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten was very well satisfied,
then, and sat quite still for a few moments
while he contemplated the equity
of things. He removed his coat and hat,
but, finding no place to put them, he
held them for a moment and then flung
them from him. He endeavored to consider
the iniquity of his coat and hat—and
it ended by his head falling forward
again, and then he dropped completely
over and went sound asleep on
the couch.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some hours later Mr. Van Nesten
awoke—a little gradually—in confusion
and with reluctance. But a blinding
stream of light was in his eyes and a
figure—a grotesque and crouching figure,
with a strip of black cloth across its
face—was before him. This he became
more or less vaguely aware of, and then
came the pressure of something cold and
hard against his right temple. He
flashed wide awake in an instant—and
perfectly, perfectly sober.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t move,” said the burglar. And
Mr. Van Nesten didn’t. The burglar
ran a deft hand over him to detect the
presence of possible fire-arms, and then
he stepped back.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Get up!” he said sharply.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten stood up. He was a young
man, of good physique, and now that
the first shock was over, did not feel
greatly afraid. He looked steadfastly
at the eyes which showed through the
holes in the black mask. The burglar
regarded him steadily, his pistol in his
hand. He was taking stock of the situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You belong here?” he demanded at
last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do,” said Van Nesten.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then”—the pistol was raised to a
level with the young man’s head—“you
open that safe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten winced. It is no light
matter to look into the muzzle of a big
revolver. He experienced a quick impulse
to duck—to fend his face—to
dodge and run, but he controlled himself
and remained perfectly quiet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t say you can’t!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar’s tone was threatening.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I won’t, though!” said Van Nesten.
He was surprised at his own quiet, firm
tones. “I won’t, though!” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The silence then was electrical. The
two men, tense as steel, stood glaring at
each other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You won’t!” The burglar’s attitude
seemed to be more tense. “You
won’t!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would—to save my life,” said
Van Nesten, “but it’s not necessary. If
you kill me you’ll have murder as well
as house-breaking to answer for—besides
being no nearer to getting the safe open.
And it might make a noise,” he added.</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar stood for an unpleasant,
concentrated moment, and then he
seemed to grow a little less intense. He
relaxed and uttered a curse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Throw up your hands!” he snapped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll do that,” said Van Nesten, and
he did.</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar put down his lantern and
produced from his pocket a piece of
stout cord. He leaped into a chair.
“Come here!” he said, with vicious
curtness. “Backwards!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten, turning about, endeavored
to comply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hands together!” said the burglar,
when he had him satisfactorily stationed.
Van Nesten’s hands came together; and
the burglar rapidly wound round and
round them at the wrists with an end of
his cord. The cold nozzle of his revolver
pressed lightly against Van Nesten’s
neck.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No monkey business!” the intruder
cautioned by way of general admonition,
as he drew it away. And then he tied
Van Nesten’s hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>He stepped down from the chair then
and directed Van Nesten to climb up
in his place. Then he bound the young
man’s ankles together. He was a strong
burglar and he bound them exceedingly
well.</p>

<p class='c013'>This done, he backed off and regarded
his work. Van Nesten stood with his
back to him, in a perfectly helpless position.
He could not even get to the floor
without severe risk of injury. The burglar
walked round and faced him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I ain’t going to gag you,” he
growled. “You understand if you make
a noise what it will be—a personal risk
to me? You understand that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand,” said Van Nesten.
“That’s the reason I’m tied. It won’t
be necessary to gag me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar grunted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s also unnecessary to keep me
standing up here,” went on Van Nesten
boldly. “Take hold of my elbow,” he
said, “and steady me so I can jump
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar glared at him an instant
in amazement, and then suddenly jerked
himself forward and seized him by the
arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jump!” he said roughly.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Van Nesten came down to the
floor again the burglar gave him a whirl
about, and pushed him over into the
chair. They regarded one another
steadily, then the burglar turned away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Keep your face shut now, will
you?” he said, and went to pick up his
lantern again.</p>

<p class='c013'>He approached the big iron safe as
a man approaches his chosen work. Van
Nesten watched him making his arrangements—inspecting,
tapping, and fingering
about—as deftly, accurately, and
readily as a skilful artisan.</p>

<p class='c013'>He never paused for an instant and
his tools seemed ready to his hand.
Finally he prepared something with a
few sharp clicks, and then he dropped
down to his knees and began to work—drilling.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten did not at all enjoy his
situation, but the pain from his thongs
soon gave way to a numbness, and then
he did not suffer so much. The only
sound for several moments was the dull
grind of the burglar’s drill.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly the burglar stopped his
work and began to snuff at the air. He
laid down his tools and raised his face
toward the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By God!” he cried excitedly, and
sprang to his feet. “What’s this smoke?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten not only smelled it, but
saw that it was pouring into the room
through the open door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This place is afire!” said the burglar.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like a flash Van Nesten’s mind went
back and he remembered himself
drunkenly ascending those stairs and
lighting matches to try and find the way.
He remembered now that when he had
entered the office there had been no
match left in his pocket. He gave a
great wrench at his thongs—but they
held him fast. Van Nesten groaned.</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar was down on the floor
again, gathering up his implements. He
was defter and quicker now than ever,
and Van Nesten, in a cold sweat, sat
watching him.</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar’s tools clinked and jingled
together as he stowed them away.
Then he suddenly leaped to his feet and
faced Van Nesten.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shoot me—strangle me—do something!”
cried Van Nesten. “For God’s
sake don’t leave me here like this!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the burglar had not hesitated an
instant. His hand had been in his pocket
even as he rose from the floor, and a
knife gleamed as he advanced with a
rush.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stab me, then!” said Van Nesten
wildly. “Stab me, then! Don’t leave
me here to roast!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” cried the burglar. He recoiled
from those words as suddenly as if
he had been hit. An upward motion tore
the mask from his face, and aghast he
glared at Van Nesten.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My God, man!” he said “what you
think I am?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The rising smoke eddied between
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the burglar recovered himself almost
instantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’re scart,” he said, “and I don’t
blame you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With two deft strokes of his knife he
severed the cords that bound Van Nesten’s
hands and feet. Then he stepped
back and thrust the knife in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s up to you,” he said. “How are
we going to get out of here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten passed a hand across his
forehead and staggered to his feet. He
stepped to the door and the burglar
quickly followed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait!” said Van Nesten. He
flashed the burglar’s lantern up and
down the hall. It was thoroughly full
of smoke. His quickening mind took in
the whole situation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on!” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>He took the burglar by the hand and
led him swiftly through the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Up?” asked the burglar.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten opened a door and they
passed out into the bindery among
stitching-machines and great stacks of
unfolded paper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good thing you brought this lantern!”
remarked Van Nesten, leading
swiftly on. They encountered another
hallway and more smoke, then a flight
of stairs, which they mounted two steps
at a time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you open a door?” asked Van
Nesten, when a locked one barred their
way. The burglar grunted and applied
himself, while Van Nesten held the
light. Neither spoke, but hot clouds of
smoke were coming up faster and faster,
and the sound of a crackling roar was
beneath them. The fire was coming on
with a rush.</p>

<p class='c013'>The door opened, and they burst into
Greddin’s paper-box factory, full of
combustibles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This way!” cried Van Nesten, taking
the burglar’s hand again. They ran
through tangled aisles of machinery,
tables, and benches, the thick smoke all
about them. Then Van Nesten reached
a window and he and the burglar seized
it together and threw it up. Shouts and
the sounds of confusion in the street
came up to them now, and in the distance
clanged the gong of an approaching fire-engine.
But there was no time to lose.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go ahead!” said Van Nesten. “It’s
one at a time now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the burglar, with his head and
shoulders through the window, drew
back, white and shaking.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My God!” he exclaimed, “have we
got to jump across there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a perfectly easy leap of five
feet to the roof of the next building,
with a twenty-four inch drop to make it
certain. “I can’t do it!” the burglar
groaned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten stared at him, appalled
at his sudden fright. “You’re crazy!”
he cried. “It’s perfectly easy. Go on,
man! Be quick!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar clutched the window-sill,
looking out with wild eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can’t!” he muttered despairingly.
“I was always this way. I can’t do it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You’ve got to!” said Van Nesten.
“By God! I’ll throw you over!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the burglar shrank away. His
nerve was utterly gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Save yourself,” he said. “It’s no
use. I’ll never make it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten glared about him. Then
he cried:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quick, man, your knife! Some belting!”
He leaped to the top of an embossing-machine
which stood near the
window and seized hold of the two-inch
leather belt which connected with its
overhead shafting. The burglar had his
knife ready and thrust it up to him.
Van Nesten slashed at the belt, and it
fell in twain. He leaped to the floor,
bearing an end of it with him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fasten it here—quick!” Van Nesten
said, circling a projecting piece of the
heavy machine. “When I jump across
throw me the other end of it. You can
cross on that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten clambered to the window-frame
and made his leap. His feet
crunched on the gravel roof of the next
building.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come on! That belt!” he cried,
rushing back to the edge of the roof.
“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar had already thrown it.
It curled in a twisted mass at Van Nesten’s
feet, and he seized it up and retreated
back on the roof with the end
of it. In vain he looked for a place to
fasten it—hither and thither he darted,
and the burglar, his white face showing
through the smoke, his crouching body
pressed down upon the window-frame,
watched him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten wrapped the belt around
his body and stretched it taut. There
were twenty feet or more of it, and
though the leverage would be against
him, he could, by keeping to the far end
of it, easily sustain the burglar’s weight
for a distance of five feet from the
window-frame on which it rested.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got you!” cried Van Nesten.
“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar crept up on the window-sill,
his feet curled beneath him. Slowly,
slowly his hand led out along the piece
of belting—he reached to the center and
part of the space that lay between him
and safety, but still, distrusting, despairing,
he clung to the window-ledge. Then
he lurched suddenly forward, and swung
by his hands over the abyss.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten, braced as he was, took a
step forward under the quick strain.
The belt sagged, and the burglar sunk
to a level with the roof. Its cornice was
almost in his face. Terror was upon
him as he hung, and he could not move.
Then the belt slipped: Van Nesten could
not hold it. The burglar gasped and
clutched at the edge of the roof. Van
Nesten, tangled in the belting, thought
that he had fallen, and he hurried forward.
The white face was beneath him
and his own wild eyes stared into it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten, breathing heavily, bent
over and took the burglar by the wrists.
Terror now was upon them both. Slowly
Van Nesten drew up the burglar who
hung inert. It was not till his waist
had passed the point of safety that the
burglar exerted himself. Then he made
a sudden frantic effort, and, wrenching
himself free from Van Nesten, he
crawled out upon the roof.</p>

<p class='c013'>He lay flat for a moment from sheer
exhaustion, then he sat up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By God!” said the burglar, passing
his hands over his face, “I don’t want
nothing more like that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten, feeling suddenly weak,
had sat down also. Now he turned toward
the burglar and burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar gave Van Nesten a quick
look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What’s to do with you and me?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Van Nesten remained cheerful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t know,” he said. “Say,” he
immediately added, “got anything you
want to burn up? The firemen’ll be
here in about a minute, you know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar took the hint. He stood
up and cast certain things through the
window to the room they had just left.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Chuck that gun over there, too,”
said Van Nesten, with just an authoritative
twang to his voice. The burglar,
giving him another quick look, complied.</p>

<p class='c013'>The burglar stood a little awkwardly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, let’s get out of here,” said Van
Nesten, springing up. “It’s getting
hot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Together they traveled over the roof
toward the fire-escape.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ORIGIN OF “THE MARSEILLAISE.”</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>The Romantic Circumstances Attending the Writing of France’s National Anthem By a Young Artillery Officer.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Probably no national hymn has
ever roused the frenzy of patriotic
enthusiasm which always attends
the singing of “The Marseillaise.” The
bloody deeds of the French Revolution
were all accompanied to the music of
this inspiring song, and curiously
enough, it seems to fire the hearts of
the people when they are actuated by
widely different motives.</p>

<p class='c013'>The origin of the song is interesting
and would seem to indicate that it was
indeed an inspiration in the true sense
of the word. Lamartine gives the story
in his “Histoire des Girondins.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the garrison of Strasburg was quartered
a young artillery officer, named
Rouget de Lisle, a native of Louis de
Salnier, in the Jura. He had a great
taste for music and poetry, and often entertained
his comrades during their long
and tedious hours in the garrison. Sought
after for his musical and poetical talent,
he was a frequent and familiar guest at
the house of one Dietrich, an Alsatian
patriot, Mayor of Strasburg.</p>

<p class='c015'>The winter of 1792 was a period of
great scarcity at Strasburg. The house
of Dietrich was poor, his table was frugal,
but a seat was always open to Rouget de
Lisle.</p>

<p class='c015'>One day there was nothing but bread
and some slices of smoked ham on the
table. Dietrich, regarding the young officer,
said to him, with sad serenity:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Abundance fails at our boards; but
what matters that, if enthusiasm fails not
at our civic <i>fêtes</i>, nor courage in the
hearts of our soldiers? I have still a last
bottle of wine in my cellar. Bring it,”
said he to one of his daughters, “and let
us drink France and Liberty! Strasburg
should have its patriotic solemnity. De
Lisle must draw from these last drops
one of those hymns which raise the soul
of the people.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The wine was brought and drank, after
which the officer departed. The night was
cold. De Lisle was thoughtful. His heart
was moved, his head heated. He returned
staggering to his solitary room and slowly
sought inspiration—sometimes in the fervor
of his citizen soul, and anon on the
keys of his instrument, composing now
the air before the words, and then the
words before the air. He sung all, and
wrote nothing, and at last, exhausted, fell
asleep with his head resting on his instrument,
and awoke not till daybreak.</p>

<p class='c015'>The music of the night returned to his
mind like the impression of a dream. He
wrote it, and ran to Dietrich, whom he
found in the garden digging winter lettuces.
The wife and daughters of the old
man were not up. Dietrich awoke them,
and called in some friends, all as passionate
as himself for music, and able to
execute the composition of De Lisle. At
the first stanza, cheeks grew pale; at
the second, tears flowed; and at the last
the delirium of enthusiasm burst forth.
The wife of Dietrich, his daughters, himself,
and the young officer, threw themselves,
crying, into each other’s arms.</p>

<p class='c015'>The hymn of the country was found.
Executed some days afterward in Strasburg,
the new song flew from city to city,
and was played by all the popular orchestras.
Marseilles adopted it to be sung at
the commencement of the sittings of the
clubs, and the Marseillaise spread it
through France, singing it along the public
roads. From this came the name of
“Marseillaise.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE LAKE OF THE DISMAL SWAMP.</h2>
</div>

<div class='c007'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_214.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
While Thomas Moore held a minor appointment
in Bermuda, early in the last century, he
visited the United States, and there found
material for several well-known poems. His
imagination was greatly struck by what he
heard of the Dismal Swamp, which at that
time was a vast morass more than forty miles
in length and twenty-five miles in width, extending
from Virginia into North Carolina,
and having in the midst of it a stagnant lake
to which few had ever penetrated. Many strange stories were told
of this gloomy swamp, with its dark recesses in which savage animals
and loathsome serpents lurked, and where, according to the
legends of the country-people, unearthly sights had at times been
seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moore’s genius gave to one of these legends a poetical form in
the lines which are here reprinted and which were long extremely
popular. It may be mentioned as a matter of interest that the
Dismal Swamp has in recent years been in part reclaimed by drainage,
and that a canal now crosses it, thus destroying its old-time
mystery and romance.</p>

    <div>Figures Which Must Convince the $10-a-Week Clerk That He Came Too Late—Had He Flourished in England Several Centuries Ago He Might Have Cut as Wide a Swath as a Present-Day Millionaire.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>It makes the ordinary, hard-working
householder envious to see the luxurious
display of fortune’s favorites. He
finds it hard enough struggle to get
the necessaries of life without any of its
delicacies, and to keep the cost within
his income. Nor can he look back into
the days of long ago for consolation. It
only increases his discomfiture to compare
his expense account with those of
his ancestors.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a man had a quarter in his pocket
in the days of the Plantagenets, for instance,
he could keep his family well
supplied for a week. With that amount
of money he could smile at the butcher,
bow openly to the grocer, and look the
rest of the world as squarely in the face
as did the village blacksmith.</p>

<p class='c014'>If he lived in England seven hundred
years ago and wished to regale his family
on mutton, he could buy the finest of fat
sheep for twenty-four cents, which would
almost allow him to give a banquet on a
pennyworth of mutton. A cow was more
expensive, but one dollar and a half would
buy the best he could find in the market,
while for a fat hog he need only part with
eighty cents.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the fourteenth century, two cents
would buy a pair of chickens, and a nickel
for a goose fit to grace any Christmas
dinner-table, and a penny would purchase
a dozen new-laid eggs; while for two cents
the brewer was compelled by law to sell
three gallons of beer, the equivalent of
forty-eight glasses.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wheat sometimes fell as low as forty
cents a quarter, though after a great
storm, or In a time of “grievous famine,”
it would rise as high as four and five
dollars a quarter. Still, at these prices a
good many pounds of bread could be
bought for a penny.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pasture and arable lands were ridiculously
cheap—two cents an acre for the
former and twelve cents an acre for the
latter being considered a fair annual
rental. Draft-horses were a drug on the
market at seventy-two cents each, and
oxen at one dollar and twenty cents. In
the days of the second Henry fifty dollars
would have equipped a farm with three
draft-horses, half a dozen oxen, twenty
cows, and two hundred sheep, leaving a
balance of two dollars toward the payment
of the rent—about five dollars a
year.</p>

<p class='c015'>As for labor, three cents a day was
deemed good wages for an ordinary
laborer, and even at harvest-time four
cents a day was the highest sum expected.</p>

<p class='c015'>House rent was so absurdly small that
the Lord Mayor of London paid only four
dollars and eighty cents a year to his
landlord; and the Chancellor, with an annual
salary of one hundred and ninety-two
dollars, seemed poorer than many a
cook of our own time. When a father
sent his son to a university six centuries
ago, four cents a day was considered a
comfortable allowance, with a margin for
such luxuries as wine at eight or twelve
cents a gallon.</p>

<p class='c015'>Twenty-four dollars a year was a munificent
salary in those days. It was the
exact sum paid to the assistant clerk of
Parliament, and more than the average
priest, with cure of souls, received; while
the pension allowed by Edward III to his
apothecary was only twelve cents a day,
and King Edward IV’s allowance to his
daughter was but four dollars and eighty
cents a week, with an additional two
hundred and forty-seven dollars and
sixty cents a year for the maintenance of
her eight servants.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth prices
were still exceedingly modest, and, it is
only fair to add, wages low in proportion.
From a household book of 1589 we take
the following typical prices: Beef, two
and a half cents a pound; a neck of mutton,
twelve cents; twenty-eight pounds of
veal and a shoulder of mutton, fifty-six
cents; cheese, four cents a pound; wheat,
three dollars and eighty-four cents a quarter
ton.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Though a Company Was Organized in 1792 to Market “Stone Coal,” As Late as 1817 a Man Who Sold Some was Charged With Swindling by Philadelphians, Who Where Unable to Make it Burn.</div>
    <div class='c011'><i>An original article written for</i> <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Coal is such a commonplace article
that few people take the trouble
to find out what it is and how it
came into use. The average householder’s
thoughts about coal are mainly confined
to questions of price.</p>

<p class='c013'>One picks up, of course, such interesting
facts as that the United States burns
three hundred and fifty million tons a
year, at a cost to consumers of about
seven hundred million dollars. In this
estimate all grades of anthracite and
bituminous coal are included. One wonders
how long the visible supply will last,
and whether the men who in future
generations are to take up the work begun
by Edison and other experimenters will
find a new source of practical heat-supply
in time to prevent a protracted “cold
spell” when the coal gives out.</p>

<p class='c013'>One is troubled, too, by the relations
between miner and operator, and is worried
when he learns that the great strike
of 1902, for example, involved a total
loss to workers, operators, railroads, and
business men of about one hundred and
fifty million dollars.</p>

<p class='c013'>But all these matters are problems of
the day—mere seconds on the clock of
Nature. If we look back over so brief a
gap as one hundred and fifteen years, we
shall see the discovery of anthracite in
America.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1791 a hunter, named Philip Ginther,
lived on the eastern slopes of the mountains
which are drained by the Lehigh
River. Late one afternoon he found himself
at the summit of Sharp Mountain. A
storm was coming up, and Ginther broke
into a run, for his home was some distance
away. Stumbling over the roots of
a fallen tree, he kicked up a black stone,
and noticed that the soil in which the
tree had grown was mingled with similar
specimens of an unusual formation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Ginther had heard that there was
“stone coal” in the mountains, so he
picked up the stumbling-block which had
checked his course, and carried it home
with him and gave it to Colonel Jacob
Weiss, who lived near the site of the present
Mauch Chunk. Colonel Weiss sent
the specimen to Philadelphia, where it
fell into the hands of Charles Cist, a
printer, who recognized it as anthracite
and advised Colonel Weiss to buy the
land where the coal had been found.</p>

<p class='c013'>To get the land was easy, for the region
was wild and remote from the easier
connections of civilization. Colonel Weiss
bought from the government several thousand
acres, and organized in 1792 the Lehigh
Coal Mine Company. His associates
included Robert Morris (the well-known
financier), John Nicholson, Charles Cist,
and J. Anthony Morris.</p>

<p class='c013'>In May, 1792, an expedition—four laborers,
with a member of the company to
direct them—set out to open and work
the mine. It was found that a great bed
of anthracite lay quite near the surface.
The company quarried several tons of the
coal.</p>

<p class='c013'>The question now was how to dispose
of the product. The anthracite was there
in vast quantity, ready to be pilfered from
old Earth; but many miles of forest and
mountain separated the mine from the
nearest market. Moreover, people were
dubious as to the burning value of anthracite,
and wood was still plentiful, and—well,
like other new products, anthracite
had to prove its usefulness before it would
be accepted.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a few weeks the laborers were
discharged. Colonel Weiss carried lumps
of coal in his saddle-bags and induced a
few of the blacksmiths of near-by settlements
to try it; but there was no general
tendency to adopt the new fuel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Pennsylvania Legislature, in 1798,
chartered a company to improve the navigation
of the Lehigh River. The work
was completed in 1802, but although the
removal of obstructions and the building
of wing-dams were something of an improvement,
the river was still likely to
prove rude to voyagers. The coal company,
however, resumed its quarrying, and
built a fleet of arks which, during high
water in the spring of 1803, were loaded
with coal and sent down the stream. Four
of the six arks were wrecked; two reached
Philadelphia. But when the Philadelphians
tried to burn the coal, they had
no success with it, and the Lehigh Coal
Mine Company abandoned its efforts to
introduce a fuel so unlucky.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1810 coal was found near Pottsville,
and blacksmiths used it successfully. A
Philadelphia chemist, after making a careful
analysis, announced that the heating
power of anthracite was extraordinary.
Colonel George Shoemaker, who had dug
up coal on his lands near Pottsville, loaded
eight or ten wagons in 1817, and took
the caravan to Philadelphia. Inasmuch as
he guaranteed that the “stones” would
burn, he succeeded in disposing of his
stock; but now, as formerly, the Philadelphians
failed to get any heat from
their purchases—except the heat of their
tempers, which led them to secure a
warrant for the arrest of Colonel Shoemaker
on the charge of swindling. He
escaped to Pottsville by making a detour,
and meantime the Fairmount nail-works,
which had bought several tons of the
anthracite, hit accidentally upon the way
to make it burn.</p>

<p class='c013'>The proprietor and several of his men
had spent a morning vainly trying to
fire up a furnace with the coal. They had
raked, stirred, poked, and used blowers,
but the stuff refused to burn. Noon came,
and the men shut the furnace door and
went to their dinner. When they came
back they found the furnace red hot. The
closed door had solved the draft problem.
The way to make anthracite burn was to
shut it in the furnace and let it alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few years more the coal industry
became established. The Lehigh company
reentered the field. They shipped 365
tons In 1820, 1,000 tons in 1821, and 2,240
in 1822. By 1830 their annual production
was more than 41,000 tons; by 1840 it
was 225,000 tons; by 1850, 722,000 tons.
Up to 1847 the company got all its coal
from its open quarry on the summit of
Sharp Mountain. Boats carried the coal
down the Lehigh.</p>

<p class='c013'>To get the product from the mine to
the river, a railway, nine miles long, was
built in 1827. Excepting a track laid in
the quarries at Quincy, Massachusetts,
this was the first railway to be operated
in the New World. Mules drew the cars
to the summit; gravity carried them
down.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little black stone which the good
people of Philadelphia rejected in 1792
has become the keystone of all our industries.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>WHY MARCH <span class='fss'>4TH</span> IS INAUGURATION DAY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>The Principal Reason for the Selection of This Date Was the Curious Fact That It Seldom Falls on Sunday.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>There have been many objections
raised to the date upon which the
Presidents of the United States are inaugurated,
chief among them being the
usually inclement weather which prevails
so early in the spring.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first President Harrison contracted
the cold which caused his death,
soon after he assumed office, at the ceremonies
attending his inauguration; and
anxiety is always expressed lest the unhappy
incident should be repeated.
There was a reason for choosing that
date, however, which very few persons
have ever heard of.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the day was fixed upon the 4th
of March, It was because that date seldom
occurred on Sunday. But three times
during our history has the inauguration
day fallen on that day. The first was the
second inaugural of James Monroe, the
fifth President, March 4, 1821; the second
was when Zachary Taylor was made
President, March 4, 1849; the third was
the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes,
on March 4, 1877.</p>

<p class='c015'>This will happen three times during
each century, or one year after every
seven leap years. Except when passing
from one century to another, there is a
slight variation, as will be observed in
the following dates of the past and future
inaugurations, of the first two centuries of
the republic:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Margaret Illington and Grace Elliston First Sought Thespian Fame Under Cognomens Now Almost Forgotten.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Although widely divergent in their
personal appearance and methods
of acting, Grace Elliston and Margaret
Illington, the first two <i>Mice</i> in “The Lion
and the Mouse,” have one thing in common—each,
after appearing on the stage
under one name for some time, changed
it for another.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Elliston, it will be remembered,
created <i>Shirley Rossmore</i> in the original
production of the well-known Klein play
last autumn, while Miss Illington went to
Chicago later on in the second company,
and made a big hit in the part when the
piece was tried in London. To take the
ladles in this order then—</p>

<p class='c013'>Along about the middle or early nineties,
a New York critic, in noticing the
appearance at the Casino of Frank Daniels
in “The Wizard of the Nile,” wound
up his comments with these two sentences:
“There were others that were
clever—and one little beauty of a maid
whose eyes played havoc with the audience.
Her name is Grace Rutter, and
she will be a star some day.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Mansfield Recognized Talent.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This “little beauty of a maid” was
only in the chorus, and although she has
not yet fulfilled the strict letter of this
prophecy, she has come pretty close to it,
and is yet young. Born in Bluff City,
Tennessee, she became interested in
amateur theatricals and in a small way
made her first professional appearance at
the old Lyceum Theater, Memphis, in
“Boccaccio.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The experience was fascinating, and an
offer from a traveling company tempted
her beyond her strength, and she went
on the road, finally reaching New York
as a member of “The Dazzler” company.</p>

<p class='c013'>At a benefit performance of some sort
she recited. Richard Mansfield happened
to be present, saw promise in her work,
and engaged her as a member of his
Garrick Theater stock company, then in
its first season at this house, which Mr.
Mansfield had just taken over from Edward
Harrigan and renamed. But as it
happened, it was also his last season
there, and Miss Rutter’s only opportunity
was to do <i>Dodo</i> in a burlesque of “Trilby”
called “Thrilby.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Hoyt &#38; McKee, who succeeded Mansfield
in the control of the Garrick, gave
Miss Rutter a small part in Hoyt’s farce,
“A Day and a Night,” which, in turn, secured
for her an opening with Daniels,
and in due course she was added to the
musical comedy forces at Daly’s, where
she was seen in “The Geisha,” “The
Circus Girl,” and other London importations.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Chose Another Ladder to Climb.</h4>

<p class='c018'>But although she might be progressing
all this while so far as salary was concerned,
the ambitions in Miss Rutter’s
heart were not being at all satisfied, and
in the spring of 1899 she resolved to begin
at the foot of the ladder again and mount
up the dramatic rather than the light
musical rounds.</p>

<p class='c013'>After some casting about and a period
of hope deferred, the ambitious young
woman obtained a chance to appear with
Daniel Frohman’s stock company at the
old Lyceum. There she made her début
in “His Excellency the Governor.” She
decided, however, that the old name was
against her, associating her as it did with
musical work, so she appeared on the
house bill as “Grace Elliston.” Perhaps
her most notable work at the Lyceum
was in the charming, fantastic curtain-raiser,
“The Shades of Night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She remained with the Lyceum company
for another season, and then, at the
Criterion, created the leading part in that
short-lived dramatization, “The Helmet
of Navarre.” When this mistake was laid
away on the upper shelf, minus camphor
balls, Miss Elliston passed to <i>Bonita</i> in a
big Academy of Music revival of “Arizona.”
Her Shakespearian aspirations
were realized in 1903–’04, when she became
<i>Olivia</i> in Viola Allen’s offering of
“Twelfth Night.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Manager Named His Future Wife.</h4>

<p class='c018'>It was in 1900 that patrons of James K.
Hackett, in “The Pride of Jennico,” saw
that the part of the gipsy girl was played
with much fire and dash by a very young
actress who was set down on the program
as Maude Light. Investigation shows this
to be the real name of a stage-struck
young woman from Bloomington, Illinois,
who, after some very modest attempts in
Chicago, had come to Daniel Frohman
with her dramatic aspirations. She was
placed in a minor rôle with the Hackett
company, to be speedily promoted to
<i>Michel</i>, the gipsy aforesaid, the second
important female part in the play. And
it wasn’t long before she was sometimes
doing that of the <i>Princess</i> herself, whenever
Bertha Galland was out of the cast.
Her change of name was made at the request
of Mr. Frohman. It seemed that
the other women were all using stage
<i>noms</i>, so when the matter was laid before
her Miss Light expressed her perfect willingness
to fall in line.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what shall I call myself?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll make you up a name,” replied Mr.
Frohman, and forthwith took her native
State, Illinois, and her home town, Bloomington,
and out of the two formed “Illington,”
prefixing “Margaret” for euphony.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the Hackett play Miss Illington
passed to the stock company at Daly’s,
still under Mr. Frohman’s management,
appearing as the <i>Maid</i> in “Frocks and
Frills,” a small part which she made
stand out vividly, and at the same theater
she did <i>Fleur de Lys</i> in “Notre
Dame.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Succeeded Miss Loftus.</h4>

<p class='c018'>E. H. Sothern’s troupe next claimed
Miss Illington’s services, and she took
Cecilia Loftus’s place as leading woman
when that actress fell ill and was obliged
to leave the stage for the hospital.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the autumn of the same year (1903)
Miss Illington created the leading part in
that distinguished failure, “A Japanese
Nightingale,” but during the brief run of
the piece she assumed a part attended
with more success—that of the wife of
her manager, Daniel Frohman. It was
announced then that she would leave the
stage at the end of the “Nightingale”
engagement, but, as so often happens in
such cases, the bridegroom proposes and
the bride elects to please herself. So the
very next spring we found her as <i>Henriette</i>
in the all-star cast of “The Two
Orphans.” And last season she filled the
title rôle in “Mrs. Leffingwell’s Boots.”</p>

<p class='c013'>For the coming winter Miss Illington is
to be entrusted with the most important
part that has yet fallen to her—that of
the leading lady with John Drew in
Pinero’s new play, “His House in Order”—a
rôle created in London with great
success by Irene Van Brugh, who made
such a hit here a few years ago with
John Hare in “The Gay Lord Quex.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>WOULDN’T STAY CURED.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Jane Wheatley Celebrated Her Recovery from First Attack of Stage Fever By Falling Victim to a Second.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Although stock company work, with
two performances a day and a weekly
change of bill, is an awful grind, it is
also about the only way nowadays in
which the young player can obtain the
necessary experience to give him or her
that versatility which broadens ability.</p>

<p class='c013'>Take, for instance, the six weeks last
spring when Jane Wheatley filled an engagement
in Providence as leading woman
of the Albee stock company, at Keith’s.
During that period she was <i>Muriel</i> in
“The Second in Command,” an English
comedy; <i>Lucy</i> in “The Dictator,” an
American farce; <i>Katherine</i> in “If I Were
King,” a romantic drama; <i>Phyllis</i> in the
Goodwin-Elliott play, “When We Were
Twenty-One”; <i>Marcelle</i> in “The Gay
Parisians,” a lively farce from the French;
and <i>Mary of Magdala</i> in the Scriptural
play, “The Holy City.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of her work in the last-named part, a
local critic wrote: “She carried the rôle
through from the moment of awakening
from the scarlet bondage with a spirit
of reverence that was much more than
mere acting, and had applause been permitted
she would have carried off all honors.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Spent Allowance for Theater Tickets.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Miss Wheatley is a young woman who
went on the stage from pure love of it,
starting In 1898 with a very lowly part In
“The Christian.” She was with Viola
Allen for three seasons, and subsequently
she played prominent parts with Sadie
Martinot. She followed Grace Filkins as
<i>Lady Airish</i>, in the support of Alice Fischer,
in “The School for Husbands.” The
account she has furnished <span class='sc'>The Scrap
Book</span> of her start in the profession is so
very entertainingly written that I am
giving it herewith in her own words:</p>

<p class='c013'>“While studying in Boston some years
ago, every penny of my allowance went
for theater tickets, and the Hollis Street
Theater was my favorite haunt. My
chum was an enthusiast on the subject,
if ever there was one, and I made a very
good second. We had our respective favorites,
and mine was Miss Viola Allen.
I always had hoped to meet her, and even
thought she might advise me or help me
to a position on the stage. But how to
arrange a meeting?</p>

<p class='c013'>“My chum (Kate) and I talked it over,
and finally decided upon a plan of action.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kate had gone to a boarding-school,
somewhere in Canada, and had heard
much from the teachers about Miss Allen,
who had been a former student there.
One of the teachers even suggested giving
Kate a letter to Miss Allen. These facts
were all we had to introduce us, but I
remember that I was the timid one and
Kate the fearless.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After the matinée one day we summoned
up courage and went to the stage
entrance, sent in our cards, and, with
beating hearts, waited. Miss Allen was
then leading woman with the Empire
stock company.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a few minutes a maid came out to
us, and with cold politeness inquired what
we wanted.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Aid from Viola Allen.</h4>

<p class='c018'>“‘We wished to see Miss Allen,’ was
our answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know now what a piece of effrontery
it was on our part, for when an actress
has played a long part, and has only a
short time before she has to play it again,
she is ready for only one thing, and that
is rest. However, Miss Allen was then,
just as she always has been, kind, and
invited us to come another day—which
we did; and this time we were successful,
for she saw us, and I remember how
happy it made me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I remember the conversation, too; for
she spoke of what was uppermost in our
minds—our ambitions. So encouraging
was the interview with this dear lady that
when I finished my studies in Boston I
wrote to her, saying that I meant to start
my professional career in the autumn,
and ‘would she help me?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“She did. In reply to my letter, she
said there were no parts in her play,
‘The Christian,’ except those requiring
experience, but that some characters
would speak in chorus, and I would be
welcome to such a part.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I remember an illustration made frequently
by Dr. Emerson at the Emerson
College. He pointed out to us that on
the stage we were like parts of a mosaic—alone
we were nothing, but as a part
of the whole, each one in his place very
necessary to the whole. I did not then
realize how very small was to be my part
of the mosaic—its proportions were exaggerated
in my mind, and I had visions
of myself in a dainty or artistic costume,
entering with two or three other young
ladles, and speaking in chorus, something
as do the four daughters in ‘The Gay
Parisians.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“I also remember Miss Allen’s apologetic
remark about the salary. ‘The
money is nothing,’ she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As for that part of it—money—it had
never entered my mind. The happiness
of having the opportunity was enough;
and to think of being paid, actually paid,
for simply doing what I loved to do! It
was all very beautiful.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Appalled by Reality.</h4>

<p class='c018'>“To skip rehearsals, which, needless
to say, were a source of great enjoyment,
as it was all so new to me, the opening
night in Albany came, and there my
troubles began.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ‘characters speaking in chorus’
formed a mob, and extra supernumeraries
were engaged for the night in Albany. It
was a wild enough mob; my pride suffered,
and my toes, too, for both were
trodden upon. The damp cellar dressing-room
with its many occupants, and the
harsh, severe directions of the stage
manager—it was all so different from
what I had expected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the course of the evening I found
a lonely corner in the despised cellar and
wept long and bitterly. Was this the way
to Fame? Could I bridge these humiliations
and discomforts? The goal seemed
very far off, and I remember repeating to
myself:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I’m cured! I’m cured!’</p>

<p class='c013'>“However, I went on to Washington
with the company. There I tried another
day of it, but conditions grew worse instead
of better. During the afternoon of
the second day in Washington I packed
my bag, walked to the station, bought a
ticket for New York, said nothing to any
one of my resolution, but wired my father
to meet me, and got on the train, bound
for home.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Moth Again Seeks Flame.</h4>

<p class='c018'>“And oh, how glad I was to see my
father, and he to see me! And how glad
he was that I was ‘cured’ of my desire
to be an actress!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, to make a long story short, I remained
‘cured’ only a short time—two
weeks, I think it was.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A nice letter from Miss Allen, saying
that she would keep my understudy for
me, enticed me to return when the company
played in New York. I refused to
give up again, although those first tears
were not the only ones I had cause to
shed during that long season.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My reward came, however, for before
the close of the theater year the girl
whose rôle I understudied left the cast,
and they gave me her part for the rest
of the season. Miss Allen helped me herself
to do justice to it—even to rehearsing
me after matinée, when she must
have been very tired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it was in my beloved Boston,
where I had first met her, that I played
my first part, and in her company, only
the theater was the old Boston Museum,
not the Hollis Street.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>DANCED ON CHURCH STEPS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Front of a Negro Place of Worship Was the Scene of Henry E. Dixey’s Preparation for the Stage.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>“The steps of a colored church near
where I lived was my practise-ground,
and I was on the stage when I
was eight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus spoke Henry E. Dixey, in his
dressing-room at the Lyric, between the
acts of “The Man on the Box,” in response
to my question about his start in
his stage career—a career that stands
out more remarkably than the majority.
After achieving a reputation in a burlesque
with which his name became so
closely identified that it was often used
interchangeably with his own, he went
into Daly’s theater and played <i>Malvolio</i>
in “Twelfth Night,” in a fashion to cover
himself with glory. He has scored high
in the Gilbert &#38; Sullivan operas, and is
now a successful star in high-class comedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dixey’s real name is Dixon. He was
born in Boston on January 6, 1859. His parents
had no connection with the theater,
and had no idea that Harry’s predilection
for dancing was going to lead him
there. When very young he helped eke
out the family income by becoming a cashboy
in a dry-goods store but he wasn’t a
shining success at it. The part he liked
best was being sent on errands, which
gave him an opportunity to collect cronies
about him and practise fancy steps on his
improvised stage in front of the African
meeting-house, as aforesaid.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Failed to Serve Two Masters.</h4>

<p class='c018'>It didn’t take the dry-goods people long
to “get on” to the idiosyncrasies of their
youthful employee, and in due course he
lost his job and was cooling his heels all
day long on the sidewalk, most of the
time in the vicinity of the stage-door of
the Howard Athenæum, then under the
management of the late John Stetson.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Stetson was putting on “Under
the Gaslight,” he needed a street urchin,
so he decided to give the little Dixon
chap a chance to show what he could
do. The child introduced a song and
dance, made an instantaneous hit, and
thus started on his career. His part was
called <i>Peanuts</i>, and he was retained at the
Howard for small bits with James S. Maffit
and his partner, Bartholomew, in their
pantomime work.</p>

<p class='c013'>How he managed to pick up an education,
with his head full of the stage, is
difficult to determine; but one has only to
talk with Mr. Dixey to know him for a
man of keen intelligence and common
sense. But his parents continued to keep
him under their eye in Boston until after
“Evangeline” was produced. Here he
encountered his old friend, James S. Maffit,
again, as the <i>Lone Fisherman</i>. Crane
was in the cast, too, doing <i>Le Blanc</i>, the
notary. Dixey was the forelegs of the
famous <i>Heifer</i>, the hind ones submitting
to the direction of Richard Golden. But
during the tour of the famous piece Dixey
did very many of the other parts in the
burlesque.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the course of the early eighties John
Stetson extended his field of operations
to New York, and set up a stock company
at the Fifth Avenue Theater. Dixey,
as one of its leading members, created
<i>Christopher Blizzard</i> in “Confusion.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>“Adonis” and Its Successors.</h4>

<p class='c018'>In New York he fell in with William F.
Gill. Dixey had some of the ideas for
“Adonis.” Gill had more, and put them
together in the shape of a burlesque.
They tried to get Dixey’s old friend and
first manager, Stetson, to bring it out at
the Boston Globe. But he got cold feet
on the proposition, declaring that it was
too expensive to mount. Rice took it in
hand, and after he had demonstrated the
thing to be a success Stetson wanted an
interest in it, in exchange for which he
was willing to plank down twenty thousand
dollars, but it was then too late.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Adonis” ran at the Bijou in New
York for more than three hundred nights,
and was afterward done in London.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Seven Ages,” built on the same
lines, was a frightful frost, if a thing can
be said to be so when done in a temperature
of one hundred and three degrees,
which Mr. Dixey avers the thermometer
registered at the old Standard in the early—and
last—nights of the piece.</p>

<p class='c013'>After “The Seven Ages”—Daly’s for
Dixey, and in this connection I want to
quote from an interview the actor gave
to a writer for the New York <cite>Dramatic
Mirror</cite> some ten years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know,” he said, “that I really
was the first <i>Svengali</i> on the stage? In
‘The Tragedy Rehearsed’ I introduced a
little Trilby burlesque, where Miss Rehan
was hypnotized into singing ‘Ben Bolt.’
That was the very earliest stage use of
Miss O’Ferrall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Afterward I went to Augustin Daly
and proposed that he should dramatize
‘Trilby,’ have Miss Rehan play the character,
and let me do <i>Svengali</i>. It would
have revolutionized things at Daly’s. But
he pooh-poohed me, and wouldn’t listen to
the idea. Instead, he put on ‘A Bundle
of Lies,’ where I had a fifteen-line part.
The play was a fearful frost.”</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Takes Dark View of Future.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Just previous to the death of Stuart
Robson, Dixey made a big success as
<i>David Garrick</i> in the play “Oliver Goldsmith,”
which Augustus Thomas wrote
for Robson; then, by way of striking variety,
Dixey went to London in a Casino
review, “The Whirl of the Town,” which
failed to please England.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few years later, when Charles Frohman
imported Barrie’s “Little Mary” to
the Empire, puzzling New York by the
play written around the stomach, Dixey
was the <i>Earl of Carlton</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dixey, by the by, does not believe in
stock companies, and is rather pessimistic
as to the future of our stage, in the
way of the supply of actors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are they coming from?” he
said to me the other night, in the course
of his chat about his own start in the
business. “What training do they get
under the present system to fit them for
any work out of a set groove into which
chance and the powers that be happen to
drop them? Suppose, for example, you
are a young man who has done good work
in amateur theatricals, and with a ‘pull’
in the shape of a letter of introduction
to a big New York manager. You are
also straight and tall and would make a
presentable appearance on the stage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, you have your interview with
the big manager of to-day. He looks you
over, presses a button, and to the obsequious
underling who answers the summons,
he says: ‘Put this gentleman in the
juvenile part in Number Three company
of “Mrs. Prettytoes’ Shoestrings.”’</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are elated at first at getting a job,
but you find later on that ‘Mrs. Prettytoes’
Shoestrings’ has long since exhausted
its drawing powers in the big cities, and
is billed for six months through the one-night
stands of Texas and Arkansas.
You play the same part for all that period,
and the next season maybe you will
receive a rôle exactly on the same lines
when, if you are lucky, week stands may
replace the single night stops.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>Where Are Actors to Come From?</h4>

<p class='c018'>“And so it goes. Because you look
the character you are assigned to it, and
you never have an opportunity to show
what you can do in the way of versatility,
and consequently you never grow. Again
I repeat, Where are the big actors in the
next generation to come from?</p>

<p class='c013'>“How about the stars of to-day? Were
they not nearly all of them shining marks
twenty years ago, having been cultivated
under the old order of things? The only
show a man has nowadays outside of the
few cheap stock companies, to play more
than one part a season, is when the first
play put out fails.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How different this was around Civil
War times, when your star traveled from
town to town and the companies in the
various theaters were obliged to be up in
the various plays he put out? Our cities
were so small then that the same people
had to be counted on to support a week’s
engagement, so the bill had to be changed
nightly. Twenty years from now I wonder
who will be the stars, how many of
them there will be, and—save the mark!—to
what artistic merit will they attain?”</p>

<p class='c013'>In a sense Mr. Dixey is himself a victim
of the system he deplores. His season
in “The Man on the Box” having
been so successful, his manager has secured
the dramatic rights to Cyrus
Townsend Brady’s novel. “Richard the
Brazen,” which will give Dixey a part on
very similar lines to the conscienceless
<i>Lieutenant Worburton</i> he enacts in the
Harold MacGrath story.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE ROMANCE OF HALLOWE’EN.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Old Superstitions and Observances to Which the Scotch Still Cling Tenaciously—Ceremonies That Accompanied Lighting of Hallow Fires—How Lassies Compel Spirits to Reveal Natures of Those Who Are to Wed Them.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Like almost all of the Christian
festivals, Hallowmas, or All Saints
day, is associated with an ancient
pagan celebration of great antiquity,
and from this older rite many of its
curious and singular observances are derived.
Hallowe’en is the vigil of the
feast of All Saints, and the custom of its
elaborate observance is general everywhere,
though its greatest development
has been reached in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c013'>Modern practise has largely omitted
what was at one time the most important
part of Hallowe’en ritual—that is, the
lighting of bonfires at nightfall by each
household. From this practise the relationship
that it bears to the older
Druidical festival of Samuin is apparent.
This was a great occasion in the days of
the ancient pagan worship, and all the
hearths were on this day rekindled from
the sacred fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>Indeed, sacred fires seem to have been
a part of the various forms of worship
of many nations. The Germanic people
had their fires, as well as the Celtic, so
the custom was not wholly Druidical, but
from the Druids came most of the superstitions
that now cluster around the eve
of the Christian festival.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Origin of the Feast.</h3>

<p class='c014'>The feast of All Saints was introduced
very early by the Christian Church because
of the impossibility of keeping a
separate day for every saint. In the
fourth century, when the persecutions of
the Christians had ceased, the first Sunday
after Easter was appointed by the
Greek Church as the day for commemorating
the martyrs generally.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the Church of Rome a like festival
was introduced about 610 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, this being
the time when the old heathen Panthéon
was consecrated to Mary and all the martyrs.</p>

<p class='c015'>The real festival of All Saints, however,
was first regularly instituted by
Pope Gregory IV, in 835, and appointed
for the first day of November. It was
admitted into England about 870, and
probably about the same time into Ireland
and Scotland. The festival is common
to the Roman Catholic, English, and
Lutheran branches of the Church.</p>

<p class='c015'>The leading idea of Hallowe’en is that
it is the time of all others when supernatural
influences are strong, and charms,
therefore, will not fail to work. Spirits,
both good and evil, walk abroad on this
one mysterious night, and divination attains
its highest power. All who choose
may avail themselves of the privileges of
the occasion with the certainty that their
questions will be answered.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Prying into the Future.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Nuts furnish the principal means of
reading the secrets of the future, and in
some parts of England the night is
known as “nutcrack night.” The nuts
are cracked and eaten, as well as being
made the oracles of the occasion, and
apples also are used in the games and for
divination.</p>

<p class='c015'>The poet Burns, in the notes to his
poem, “Hallowe’en,” speaks of the passion
which human nature has had, in all
ages, for prying into the future—particularly
unenlightened human nature; yet it
is not always the ignorant who indulge
in the Hallowe’en pranks. It is by the
peasantry in the west of Scotland, however,
that the night is regarded with sincere
veneration and believed to be truly
great with meaning.</p>

<p class='c015'>Burns gives some of the spells and
charms whereby the lassies test their
fate. Among these customs are the
pulling stalks of corn, the blue clue, and
eating an apple before the glass. He also
mentions sowing hemp-seed, “to winn
three wechts o’naethings,” “to fathom
the stack three times,” “to dip your left
shirt-sleeve in a burn where three lairds’
lands meet,” and, finally, a curious process
“with three luggies or dishes.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Another writer tells of fagots made of
heath, broom, and dressings of flax tied
upon a pole. These are lighted and then
carried upon the shoulders of some one
who runs around the village, attended by
a crowd. Weird effects are produced on
a dark night, when numbers of these fagots
are blazing at the same time.</p>

<p class='c015'>Still another writer tells of the custom
of collecting the ashes from the bonfire
when the fire has burned out. They are
carefully gathered into the form of a
circle, and a stone for every person of
the several families interested in the fire
is put into this magic pile. If any stone
is injured or moved next morning it signifies
that the person represented by that
stone is “fey,” and will not live a twelve-month
from that day.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Kindling the Hallow Fire.</h3>

<p class='c017'>In the days when the “hallow fire”
was kindled, various magic ceremonies
preceded its lighting. These exorcised
the demons and witches and rendered
them powerless. When the ceremonies
were finished, the fire was lighted and
carefully guarded by the men of the family
from the depredations of certain societies
which were formed, sometimes
through pique and at other times for fun
alone, for the purpose of scattering these
fires. The attack and defense were often
“conducted with art and fury.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The first ceremony of Hallowe’en was
pulling the kail (stalk). By its shape
and size the young women determined
the figure and size of their future husbands,
while any “yird,” or earth,
sticking to the roots meant fortune.
The taste of the “custoc,” or heart of the
stalk, showed the temper and disposition,
and finally the stems or “runts” are
placed above the door, and the Christian
name of the person whom Fate sends
first through the door gives the name of
the gentleman.</p>

<p class='c015'>In an old book of the early part of the
sixteenth century there is a passage as
follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“We rede in olde tyme good people
wolde on All Halowen daye bake brade
and dele it for all crysten soules.”</p>

<p class='c015'>This refers to the ancient custom of
the poor going “a-souling,” or asking for
money which they earned by fasting for
the souls of the alms-givers and his kinsfolk.
Presumably the “brede” was not
eaten until the day after.</p>

<p class='c015'>In some places these loaves were
called “sau’mas loaves”—soul-mass—and
were kept in the house for luck.
Bakers gave them to their customers, and
thus they resembled the Good-Friday
bread and cross-buns.</p>

<p class='c015'>The vigil and ringing of bells all night
long upon All Hallows was abolished
under Henry VIII, but, in spite of this,
half a century later, under Elizabeth, a
special injunction forbade all superfluous
ringing of bells. Evidently the laws were
not enforced then any more than now,
and the nerves of the people were tried
as they are in these days. It is our doorbells,
however, not church-bells, that
keep us on edge, with the small boy at
the button.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>TWO INTERESTING DOCUMENTS, RECOGNIZED AS AUTHENTIC, THAT BEAR UPON THE LIFE OF THE SAVIOUR.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c014'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_226.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The Greek Church preserves a very interesting
tradition which seems to rest upon some evidence
which many Biblical scholars accept as
quite convincing. The tradition relates that
while Christ was working His miracles in
Palestine the report of His divine power
spread throughout Asia Minor until it reached
the ears of Abgar, the Prince of Edessa in
Mesopotamia. Abgar was afflicted with leprosy;
and at last, in his despair, he is said to
have written a letter to Christ beseeching Him to journey to Edessa
and heal the prince of his disease. To this appeal the legend says
that Christ dictated a reply by the hand of St. Thomas the Apostle,
and that after the crucifixion St. Thomas sent Thaddeus, one of the
Seventy, to Edessa, where he cured Abgar, who, with all his subjects,
became converted to Christianity.</p>

<p class='c015'>The tradition is very old, and is believed among the Eastern
Christians. It is first found recorded by the Greek writer, Eusebius,
in his “Ecclesiastical History,” written about the year 330.
Eusebius gives copies of both letters. It was not until the year
494 that the Roman Church declared the letter of Christ to be
fictitious. The Greek Church has never made any such declaration.
Among those scholars who have accepted the letters as authentic
are Tillemont and the German theologian Welte. The following is
a translation of the two documents:</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ABGAR TO JESUS CHRIST.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>“Abgar, Prince of Edessa, to Jesus, the merciful
Saviour, who has appeared in the country
of Jerusalem, greeting. I have been informed of
the prodigies and cures wrought by you without
the use of herbs or medicines, and by the efficacy
of your words alone. I am told that you enable
cripples to walk; that you force devils from the
bodies possessed; that there is no disease, however
incurable, which you do not heal; and that
you restore the dead to life. These wonders
convince me that you are some god descended
from heaven, or that you are the Son of God. For
this reason, I have taken the liberty of writing this
letter to you, beseeching you to come to see me,
and to cure me of the indisposition under which I
have so long labored. I understand that the Jews
persecute you, murmur at your miracles, and plan
your destruction. I have here a beautiful and
pleasant city which, though it be not very large,
will be sufficient to supply you with every thing
that is necessary.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>JESUS CHRIST TO ABGAR.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>“You are happy, Abgar, thus to have believed
in me without having seen me; for it is
written of me, that they who shall see me will not
believe in me, and that they who have never seen
me shall believe and be saved. As to the desire
you express in receiving a visit from me, I must
tell you that all things for which I am come must
be fulfilled in the country where I am. When this
is done, I must return to Him who sent me. And
when I am departed hence, I will send to you one
of my disciples, who will cure you of the disease
of which you complain, and give life to you and
to those that are with you.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Fame and Fortune Await Those Who Rescue from Oblivion’s Great Storage-House Bits of Knowledge That Enabled Old-Time Workmen to Obtain Results That Cannot be Duplicated To-day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The nineteenth century was distinctively
a century of invention.
Whether the twentieth is destined
to rival it by making discoveries that will
rank with steam, electricity, wireless
telegraphy, the harvester and the typewriter
it is now too soon to say. It is
safe to predict, however, that if by any
series of fortunate chances it should earn
the right to be called a “century of rediscovery,”
it would win the gratitude of
posterity, and fortune as well as fame
would be the portion of men who might
reclaim for mankind some remarkable
secrets that were well known to the civilized
world many centuries ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>In Oblivion’s great storage-house are
thousands of bits of knowledge which
were possessed by many men when the
world was much younger than it is to-day.
But they have been so thoroughly
forgotten by mankind that they are now
referred to as lost secrets, as difficult
to rediscover as those which lurk in the
mystical notes of a Stradivarius violin.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Art of Egyptian Embalmers.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Thousands of years ago, for instance,
the Egyptians used to embalm the bodies
of their dead kings and nobility so perfectly
that the bodies are in wonderful
preservation to-day, as may be seen at
the British Museum. Clever as we are
in this age, we cannot do the same. The
valuable secret is lost, and modern science
cannot recover the lost knowledge.
We can, of course, and we do, embalm
bodies; but only for temporary preservation,
and, comparatively speaking, in a
most unsatisfactory manner.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bodies which are embalmed nowadays
will not be preserved for more than a
few years at most; very many of the
bodies the Egyptians embalmed before
the birth of Christ are still so perfect
that the lines of their faces are as clearly
marked as when they were first embalmed.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sheffield turns out the finest, hardest,
and most perfect steel the world produces;
but even Sheffield cannot produce
a sword-blade to compare with those the
Saracens made and used hundreds of
years ago, and the Saracens never possessed
the machinery we have nor had
the advantage of knowing so much about
metals as we are supposed to know.</p>

<p class='c015'>A huge fortune awaits the man who
discovers the secret which enabled the
Saracens to make sword-blades so keen
and hard that they could cut in two
most of the swords used in our army
to-day.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>French Paste Diamonds.</h3>

<p class='c017'>There are a dozen different methods of
making artificial diamonds, but none of
the stones produced by these methods
can compare with those made of old
French paste, the secret of which is lost.
So perfect were paste diamonds that it
was difficult for even a person with expert
knowledge of diamonds to tell that
they were artificially produced, whereas
most of the modern artificial diamonds
can easily be detected, and their durability
is nothing like so great as the old
paste diamonds; indeed, good paste diamonds
are now almost as valuable as
real diamonds.</p>

<p class='c015'>Probably not one out of every ten thousand
buildings standing in all parts of
the world and built by modern masons
will still be standing five hundred years
hence. We do not know how to put
stones and bricks together as the ancients
did, and consequently the buildings
we raise nowadays are really mere temporary
structures, and will be in ruins
when the ancient buildings of Greece and
Italy, which were built thousands of years
ago, are in as good condition as they are
now.</p>

<p class='c015'>The secret is not in the bricks or the
stone, but in the cement and mortar,
neither of which essentials can we make
as the ancients made them.</p>

<p class='c015'>In modern buildings the cement and
mortar are the weakest points; in the
buildings which the Romans and Greeks
raised thousands of years ago the cement
and mortar are the strongest points, and
hold good while the very stones they bind
together crumble away with age. We
cannot, with all our science, make such
cement and mortar, and therefore we
cannot build such buildings as the ancients
raised.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Wonderful Ancient Dyes.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Chemistry, one might Imagine, is the
science which has, perhaps, made the
greatest strides during the last five or six
decades. Yet modern chemists cannot
compound such dyes as were commonly
used when the great nations of to-day
were still unborn. Now and again it happens
that searchers after antiquities
come across fragments of fabrics which
were dyed thousands of years ago, and
they are astonished by the wonderful
richness of the colors of the cloths,
which, despite their age, are brighter and
purer than anything we can produce.</p>

<p class='c015'>Modern artists buy their colors ready
made, and spend large sums of money
on pigments with which to color their
canvases. The pictures of modern artists
will be colorless when many of the works
of ancient masters are as bright as they
are to-day. Just as the secret of dyeing
has been lost, so has the secret of preserving
the colors of artists’ paints. Yet
the secret was known to every ancient
artist, for they all mixed their own
colors.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Formula for Durable Ink.</h3>

<p class='c017'>How to make durable ink Is another
great secret we have lost. Look at any
letter five or ten years old and you will
probably notice that the writing has faded
to a brown color and is very indistinct.
Go to any big museum, and you will find
ancient manuscripts, the writing of which
is as black and distinct as if the manuscript
were written the day before yesterday.</p>

<p class='c015'>The secret of glass blowing and tinting
is not yet entirely lost; there are still
a few men who can produce glass-work
equal to that which the ancients turned
out hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the average glass manufacturer
cannot produce anything that could at
all compare with some of the commoner
articles the Egyptians, and, later, the
founders of Venice manufactured; and
those who still hold the ancient secret
guard it so closely that it will probably
die with them and be added to the long
list of things in which our ancestors beat
us hollow.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>There is a procession of seed-time,
blossom, and fruit around the
globe which never ends. It is
harvest-time on the earth at every time
of year, just as there is always sunlight
shining somewhere and always darkness
somewhere else.</p>

<p class='c014'>January sees harvest ended in most districts
in Australia and New Zealand,
while the people of Chile and other countries
of southern South America are just
beginning to reap the fruits of their toil.</p>

<p class='c015'>Upper Egypt and India begin and continue
harvest through the months of
February and March.</p>

<p class='c015'>April enlarges the number with harvest
in Syria, Cyprus, coast of Egypt, Mexico,
Cuba, Persia, and Asia Minor.</p>

<p class='c015'>May is a busy time in Central Asia,
Persia, Algeria, Morocco, southern Texas,
Florida, China, and Japan.</p>

<p class='c015'>June calls forth the harvest in California,
Oregon, southern United States,
Spain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Rumania,
Turkey, Danubian States, southern
France, Greece, and Sicily.</p>

<p class='c015'>July sees harvest in England, Nebraska,
Switzerland, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana,
Minnesota, Upper Canada, northern
France, Germany, Austria, and Poland.</p>

<p class='c015'>August continues the gathering in the
British Isles, France, Germany, Belgium,
Holland, Manitoba, Lower Canada, Denmark,
and Russia.</p>

<p class='c015'>September rules northern Scotland,
southern parts of Sweden and Norway, as
well as the cold islands of the North Sea.</p>

<p class='c015'>October is the harvest month for corn

  <h2 class='c005'>Major Namby.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By</span> WILKIE COLLINS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='double'>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c023'>Wilkie Collins (1824–1889) was distinguished chiefly for his tendency
to confront his readers with a startling and apparently inexplicable
situation, and then by a process of analysis, which, at times, was worthy
of Poe, effect a solution of the mystery in a manner that left one amazed
by the very simplicity of it all. Shortly after the death of Mr. Collins, the
London <cite>Spectator</cite> thus described his method:</p>

<p class='c015'>“He was a literary chess-player of the first force, with power of carrying
his plan right through the game and making every move tell. His
method was to introduce a certain number of characters, set before them a
well-defined object, such as the discovery of a secret, the revindication of
a fortune, the tracking of a crime, or the establishment of a doubted marriage,
and then bring in other characters to resist or counterplot their
efforts. Each side makes moves, almost invariably well-considered and
promising moves; the countermoves are equally good; the interest goes on
accumulating till the looker-on—the reader is always placed in that attitude—is
rapt out of himself by strained attention; and then there is a sudden
and totally unexpected mate.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But Collins had a lighter side. Nearly all his characters were invested
with some degree of humor—a humor which could not forbear flashing into
some of the novelist’s darker scenes. “The Stolen Letter,” which appeared in
the June number of <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>, affords an example of the manner in
which Collins was wont to blend humor and mystery. In “Major Namby,”
which is printed herewith, we have a clever character-sketch in which
humor is seen to be the dominant element.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>I am a single lady—single, you will
please to understand, entirely because
I have refused many excellent
offers. Pray don’t imagine from
this that I am old. Some women’s
offers come at long intervals, and other
women’s offers come close together.
Mine came remarkably close together—so,
of course, I cannot possibly be old.
Not that I presume to describe myself
as absolutely young, either; so much depends
on people’s points of view. I
have heard female children of the ages
of eighteen or nineteen called young
ladies. This seems to me to be ridiculous—and
I have held that opinion,
without once wavering from it, for more
than ten years past. It is, after all, a
question of feeling; and, shall I confess
it? I feel so young!</p>

<p class='c013'>I live in the suburbs, and I have
bought my house. The major lives in
the suburbs, next door to me, and <i>he</i>
has bought his house. I don’t object
to this, of course. I merely mention it
to make things straight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Major Namby has been twice married.
His first wife—dear, dear! how can I
express it? Shall I say, with vulgar
abruptness, that his first wife had a
family? And must I descend into particulars,
and add that they are four in
number, and that two of them are twins?
Well, the words are written; and if they
will do over again for the same purpose,
I beg to repeat them in reference
to the second Mrs. Namby (still alive),
who has also had a family, and is—no,
I really cannot say is likely to go on
having one.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are certain limits in a case of
this kind, and I think I have reached
them. Permit me simply to state that
the second Mrs. Namby has three children
at present. These, with the first
Mrs. Namby’s four, make a total of
seven. The seven are composed of five
girls and two boys. And the first Mrs.
Namby’s family all have one particular
kind of constitution, and the second
Mrs. Namby’s family all have another
particular kind of constitution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let me explain once more that I
merely mention these little matters, and
that I don’t object to them.</p>

<p class='c013'>My complaint against Major Namby
is, in plain terms, that he transacts the
whole of his domestic business in his
front garden. Whether it arises from
natural weakness of memory, from total
want of a sense of propriety, or from a
condition of mind which is closely allied
to madness of the eccentric sort, I cannot
say; but the major certainly does,
sometimes partially and sometimes entirely,
forget his private family matters,
and the necessary directions connected
with them, while he is inside the house,
and does habitually remember them,
and repair all omissions by bawling
through his windows at the top of his
voice, as soon as he gets outside the
house.</p>

<p class='c013'>It never seems to occur to him that
he might advantageously return indoors,
and there mention what he has forgotten
in a private and proper way. The instant
the lost idea strikes him—which
it invariably does, either in his front
garden or in the roadway outside his
house—he roars for his wife, either from
the gravel walk or over the low wall,
and (if I may use so strong an expression)
empties his mind to her in public,
without appearing to care whose ears he
wearies, whose delicacy he shocks, or
whose ridicule he invites.</p>

<p class='c013'>If the man is not mad, his own small
family fusses have taken such complete
possession of all his senses that he is
quite incapable of noticing anything else,
and perfectly impenetrable to the opinions
of his neighbors. Let me show that
the grievance of which I complain is no
slight one, by giving a few examples of
the general persecution that I suffer,
and the occasional shocks that are administered
to my delicacy, at the coarse
hands of Major Namby.</p>

<p class='c013'>We will say it is a fine, warm morning.
I am sitting in my front room,
with the window open, absorbed over a
deeply interesting book. I hear the
door of the next house bang; I look up,
and see the major descending the steps
into his front garden.</p>

<p class='c013'>He walks—no, he marches—half way
down the front garden path, with his
head high in the air and his chest stuck
out, and his military cane fiercely flourished
in his right hand. Suddenly he
stops, stamps with one foot, knocks up
the hinder part of the brim of his extremely
curly hat with his left hand,
and begins to scratch at that singularly
disagreeable-looking roll of fat, red
flesh in the back of his neck (which
scratching, I may observe, in parentheses,
is always a sure sign, in the case of
this horrid man, that a lost domestic
idea has suddenly come back to him).</p>

<p class='c013'>He waits a moment in the ridiculous
position just described, then wheels
round on his heel, looks up at the first-floor
window, and, instead of going back
into the house to mention what he has
forgotten, bawls out fiercely from the
middle of the walk:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Matilda!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I hear his wife’s voice—a shockingly
shrill one; but what can you expect of
a woman who has been seen, over and
over again, in a slatternly striped wrapper,
as late as two o’clock in the afternoon?—I
hear his wife’s voice answer
from inside the house:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said it was a south wind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It isn’t a south wind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lor’, dear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s a sou’east. I won’t have
Georgina taken out to-day. (Georgina
is one of the first Mrs. Namby’s family,
and they are all weak in the chest.)
Where’s nurse?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nurse, I won’t have Jack allowed to
run. Whenever that boy perspires he
catches cold. Hang up his hoop. If he
cries, take him into my dressing-room
and show him the birch-rod. Matilda?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What the devil do they mean by
daubing all that grease over Mary’s hair?
It’s beastly to see it—do you hear?—beastly!
Where’s Pamby?” (Pamby
is the unfortunate workwoman who
makes and mends the family linen.)</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pamby, what are you about now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>No answer. Pamby, or somebody else,
giggles faintly. The major flourishes
his cane in a fury.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why the devil don’t you answer me?
I give you three seconds to answer me,
or leave the house. One—two—three.
Pamby! what are you about now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you please, sir, I’m doing something——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Something particular for baby, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Drop it directly, whatever it is.
Nurse!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mind the crossings. Don’t let the
children sit down if they’re hot. Don’t
let them speak to other children.
Don’t let them get playing with strange
dogs. Don’t let them mess their things.
And above all, don’t bring Master Jack
back in a perspiration. Is there anything
more before I go out?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Matilda! Is there anything more?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, dear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pamby! Is there anything more?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here the domestic colloquy ends, for
the time being. Will any sensitive person—especially
a person of my own sex—please
to imagine what I must suffer
as a delicate single lady, at having all
these family details obtruded on my attention,
whether I like it or not, in the
major’s rasping martial voice, and in the
shrill answering screams of the women
inside? It is bad enough to be submitted
to this sort of persecution when one
is alone; but it is far worse to be also
exposed to it—as I am constantly—in
the presence of visitors, whose conversation
is necessarily interrupted, whose
ears are necessarily shocked, whose very
stay in my house is necessarily shortened
by Major Namby’s unendurably public
way of managing his private concerns.</p>

<p class='c013'>Only the other day, my old, dear, and
most valued friend, Lady Malkinshaw,
was sitting with me, entering at length
into the interesting story of her second
daughter’s unhappy marriage engagement,
and of the dignified manner in
which the family ultimately broke it off.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a quarter of an hour or so our
interview continued to be delightfully
uninterrupted. At the end of that time,
however, just as Lady Malkinshaw, with
the tears in her eyes, was beginning to
describe the effect of her daughter’s
dreadful disappointment on the poor,
dear girl’s mind and looks, I heard the
door of the major’s house bang as usual,
and, looking out of the window in despair,
saw the major himself strut half
way down the walk, stop, scratch violently
at his roll of red flesh, wheel
round so as to face the house, consider
a little, pull his tablets out of his waistcoat
pocket, shake his head over them,
and then look up at the front windows,
preparatory to bawling as usual at the
degraded female members of his household.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Malkinshaw, quite ignorant of
what was coming, happened, at the same
moment, to be proceeding with her pathetic
story, in these terms:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do assure you, my poor, dear girl
behaved throughout with the heroism of
a martyr. When I had told her of the
vile wretch’s behavior, breaking it to
her as gently as I possibly could; and
when she had a little recovered I said
to her——”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Matilda!”)</p>

<p class='c013'>The major’s rasping voice sounded
louder than ever, as he bawled out that
dreadful name just at the wrong moment.
Lady Malkinshaw started as if
she had been shot. I put down the window
in despair; but the glass was no
protection to our ears—Major Namby
can roar through a brick wall. I apologized—I
declared solemnly that my next
door neighbor was mad—I entreated
Lady Malkinshaw to take no notice, and
to go on. That sweet woman immediately
complied.</p>

<p class='c013'>I burn with indignation when I think
of what followed. Every word from the
Nambys’ garden (which I distinguish
below by parentheses) came, very slightly
muffled by the window, straight into
my room, and mixed itself up with her
ladyship’s story in this inexpressibly
ridiculous and impertinent manner:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” my kind and valued friend
proceeded, “as I was telling you, when
the first natural burst of sorrow was
over, I said to her——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear Lady Malkinshaw,” I
murmured encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said to her——”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“By jingo, I’ve forgotten something!
Matilda, when I made my
memorandum of errands, how many had
I to do?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘My dearest, darling child,’ I
said——”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Pamby, how many errands did
your mistress give me to do?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said, ‘My dearest, darling
child——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Nurse, how many errands did your
mistress give me to do?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘My own love,’ I said——”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Pooh! pooh! I tell you, I had
four errands to do, and I’ve only got
three of ’em written down. Check me
off, all of you—I’m going to read my
errands.”)</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Your own proper pride, love,’ I
said, ‘will suggest to you——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Gray powder for baby.”)</p>

<p class='c013'>—“‘the necessity of making up your
mind, my angel, to——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Row the plumber for infamous
condition of back kitchen sink.”)</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘to return all the wretch’s letters,
and——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Speak to the haberdasher about
patching Jack’s shirts.”)</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘all his letters and presents, darling.
You need only make them up into
a parcel, and write inside——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Matilda! is that all?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>—“‘and write inside——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Pamby! is that all?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>—“‘and write inside——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Nurse! is that all?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I have my mother’s sanction for
making one last request of you. It is
this——’”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“What have the children got for
dinner to-day?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>—“it is this: return me my letters, as
I have returned yours. You will find
inside——”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“A shoulder of mutton and onion
sauce? And a devilish good dinner,
too.”)</p>

<p class='c013'>The coarse wretch roared out those
last shocking words cheerfully, at the
top of his voice. Hitherto, Lady Malkinshaw
had preserved her temper with
the patience of an angel; but she began—and
who can wonder?—to lose it at
last.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is really impossible, my dear,”
she said, rising from her chair, “to continue
any conversation while that very
intolerable person persists in talking to
his family from his front garden. No!
I really cannot go on—I cannot, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Just as I was apologizing to my sweet
friend for the second time, I observed,
to my great relief (having my eyes still
on the window), that the odious major
had apparently come to the end of his
domestic business for that morning, and
had made up his mind at last to relieve
us of his presence. I distinctly saw him
put his tablets back in his pocket, wheel
round again on his heel, and march
straight to the garden gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>I waited until he had his hand on the
lock to open it; and then, when I felt
that we were quite safe, I informed dear
Lady Malkinshaw that my detestable
neighbor had at last taken himself off,
and, throwing open the window again
to get a little air, begged and entreated
her to oblige me by resuming the charming
conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where was I?” inquired my distinguished
friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You were telling me what you
recommended your poor darling to
write inside your inclosure,” I answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, yes—so I was. Well, my dear,
she controlled herself by an admirable
effort, and wrote exactly what I told
her. You will excuse a mother’s partiality,
I am sure—but I think I never
saw her look so lovely, so mournfully
lovely, I should say, as when she was
writing those last lines to the man who
had so basely trifled with her. The
tears came into my eyes as I looked at
her sweet, pale cheeks; and I thought to
myself——”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“Nurse! which of the children was
sick, last time, after eating onion
sauce?”)</p>

<p class='c013'>He had come back again!—the monster
had come back again, from the very
threshold of the garden gate, to shout
that unwarrantable, atrocious question
in at his nursery window!</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Malkinshaw bounced off her
chair at the first note of his horrible
voice, and changed toward me instantly—as
if it had been my fault—in
the most alarming and most unexpected
manner. Her ladyship’s face became
awfully red; her ladyship’s head trembled
excessively; her ladyship’s eyes
looked straight into mine with an indescribable
fierceness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why am I thus insulted?” inquired
Lady Malkinshaw, with a slow
and dignified sternness which froze the
blood in my veins. “What do you
mean by it?” continued her ladyship,
with a sudden rapidity of utterance that
quite took my breath away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before I could remonstrate with my
friend for visiting her natural irritation
on poor, innocent me, before I could declare
that I had seen the major actually
open his garden gate to go away, the
provoking brute’s voice burst in on us
again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ha, yes?” we heard him growl to
himself in a kind of shameless domestic
soliloquy. “Yes, yes, yes—Sophy was
sick, to be sure. Curious. All Mrs.
Namby’s stepchildren have weak chests
and strong stomachs. All Mrs. Namby’s
own children have weak stomachs
and strong chests. <i>I</i> have a strong
stomach <i>and</i> a strong chest. Pamby!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I consider this,” continued Lady
Malkinshaw, literally glaring at me in
the fulness of her indiscriminate exasperation—“I
consider this to be unwarrantable
and unladylike. I beg to
know——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where’s Bill?” burst in the major
from below, before she could add another
word. “Matilda! Nurse! Pamby!
where’s Bill? I didn’t bid Bill
good-by—hold him up at the window,
one of you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear Lady Malkinshaw,” I remonstrated,
“why blame <i>me</i>? What
have I done?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Done?” repeated her ladyship.
“Done? All that is most unfriendly,
most unwarrantable, most unladylike,
most——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ha! ha! ha-a-a-a!” roared the major,
shouting her ladyship down, and
stamping about the garden in fits of
fond paternal laughter. “Bill, my boy,
how are you? There’s a young Turk
for you! Pull up his frock—I want to
see his jolly legs——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Malkinshaw screamed and
rushed to the door. I sank into a chair,
and clasped my hands in despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ha! ha! ha-a-a-a! What calves
the dog’s got! Pamby! look at his
calves. Aha! bless his heart, his legs
are the model of his father’s! The
Namby build, Matilda; the Namby
build, every inch of him! Kick again,
Bill—kick out, like mad. I say, ma’am!
I beg your pardon, ma’am——”</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Ma’am?</i> I ran to the window. Was
the major actually daring to address
Lady Malkinshaw, as she passed indignantly,
on her way out, down my front
garden? He was! The odious monster
was pointing out his—his, what
shall I say?—his <i>undraped</i> offspring to
the notice of my outraged visitor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at him, ma’am. If you’re a
judge of children, look at him. There’s
a two-year-older for you! Ha! ha!
ha-a-a-a! Show the lady your legs,
Bill—kick out for the lady, you dog,
kick out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>In the United States, a great
fire in Chicago destroys a
large portion of the city; property loss,
one hundred and ninety million five
hundred and twenty-six thousand dollars;
several hundred people are killed,
and over one hundred thousand are
rendered homeless; area burned, three
and a half square miles. In the same
month, October, vast fires rage in northern
Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota,
with appalling loss of life. A commission
of British and American statesmen meets
In Washington and frames a treaty with
reference to the claims of the United
States against Great Britain for damage
done during the Civil War by the Confederate
cruiser Alabama and other Confederate
vessels built and equipped in
English ports; by terms of treaty the
question is submitted to a board of arbitration
to convene at Geneva next year.
In New York, the corrupt Tweed ring is
broken up, and its head, William M.
Tweed, arrested and held in two million
dollars bail. Under authority of Congress,
President Grant takes steps to promote
improvement in the Civil Service; he appoints
a commission under George W.
Curtis (see 1873). An act of Congress
creates the Centennial Commission representing
all States and Territories: it
is authorized to prepare for a great
international exhibition at Philadelphia in
1876, in celebration of the nation’s centennial
anniversary. Passage of the
Force Bill to suppress the “Kuklux
Klan” in the South. Death of George
Ticknor, American writer and philologist;

<p class='c013'>In England, the system of purchasing
commissions and promotions in the army
is abolished, and also the requirements of
religious tests in the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge. Russia gives notice
that she will no longer be held by the
treaty made after the Crimean War,
under which she abrogated naval rights
in the Black Sea; England and other powers
acquiesce. Death of Sir John Herschel,
astronomer, and of George Grote,
historian and philosopher.</p>

<p class='c013'>In France, the siege of Paris is ended
by capitulation and armistice, pending
formation of a government to negotiate
peace with the victorious Germans. A
National Assembly, selected by popular
vote, meets at Bordeaux and selects M.
Thiers as “executive head” of the Republic
with a coalition cabinet representing
the several factions. M. Thiers
negotiates peace by which Germany annexes
Alsace, except the city of Belfort,
and a part of Lorraine (Treaty of Frankfort);
indemnity to Germany, one billion
dollars; German troops to occupy France
pending its final payment. M. Thiers
now made President of the French Republic.
Meantime, civil war breaks out
in Paris, and the Commune is established
with a reign of bloodshed, cruel
reprisals, and wanton destruction of property;
burning of the Tuileries, the
Louvre, Hôtel de Ville, and leveling of
the Vendôme Column; barbarous murder
of the hostages, including Archbishop
Darboy. Commune is finally quelled
after bombardment, assault, and capture
of city by French Government troops;
leaders of Commune executed; lives lost
during the conflict, fourteen thousand.
The Mont Cenis tunnel is opened for
traffic, thus piercing the barrier of the
Alps between France and Italy. Death of

<p class='c013'>In Spain, Minister Serrano having resigned,
King Amadeus first appoints
Zorilla and then Sagasta in his place. The
excellent qualities of King Amadeus fail
to compensate for his being a foreigner,
while his honesty of purpose alienates
him from all political factions. Meantime,
the Alfonsists and Carlists organize their
hostility and raise standard of war. In
Germany, William I triumphantly returns
to Berlin, after having been proclaimed
Emperor of Germany in the palace of
Versailles (see France). The first Reichstag
of the new German Empire is formally
opened. In Italy, the seat of government
is transferred from Florence to
Rome, the first Italian Government in
Rome for many centuries. In Mexico,
Juarez is again elected President, but by

that surround him and warnings and
attempts to assassinate him; but being
surrounded by traitorous ministers and
generals, with the army disorganized and
rule in Spain under a constitution appearing
to be impossible, the king at length
decides to abdicate (see 1873). In Germany,
the meeting in Berlin of the Emperors

to press demand for legislative
independence; the Irish Land League is
organized. Gladstone endeavors to establish
an Irish university on a non-sectarian

monarchists, tenders his resignation,
which is accepted by a small majority in
the assembly: great dismay and regret
among the people at large. General MacMahon,
favored by the monarchists, is
elected President by the assembly; the
Duc de Broglie, grandson of Mme. de
Staël, is made Prime Minister. The monarchist
majority negotiates with the
Comte de Chambord, heir of the Bourbon
kings (the so-called Henry V), who declines
the throne, however, rather than
govern under a constitution or “abandon
the Bourbon White Flag for the Revolutionary
Tri-Color.” The royalists now feel

In Spain, King Amadeus communicates
his abdication to the Cortes and
leaves Spain, respected by the better
class for chivalric bearing and honesty,
but hated by masses because a foreigner.
The Cortes now declares in favor of a republic,
with Figueras as President, and
Castelar foreign minister; but insurrections
occur, and a new Ministry is

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>Enos Wilson, an enthusiastic fisherman
from Brockton, Massachusetts,
who is here on his spring vacation, is
receiving the congratulations of his
friends.</p>

<p class='c013'>While out fishing in a canoe lately
Enos got a bite from a dogfish. The dogfish
bit the bottom out of the canoe and
also carried away a portion of Mr. Wilson’s
trousers.</p>

<p class='c013'>This so enraged the doughty fisherman
that he threw away his rod and line, and,
jumping into the water, swam after the
fish, overtaking it and holding it under
the water until it was drowned.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dogfish weighed nineteen and a
quarter pounds on its own scales. It was
a fresh-water dogfish and very vicious.—<i>Boston

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>“Trains in the South travel awfully

Atlanta, at the Plankinton House, “but
it’s a base libel to say that conductors
will stop trains to accommodate passengers

<h3 class='c016'>A STORY IN STONE.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>A Yankee traveling in England listened
for some time to a crowd
of men talking together about the wonders
they had seen in other lands. While
others expressed surprise at what they
heard, the Yankee remained passive, and
he even yawned when others were working
up to a high pitch of excitement. At
length one of the travelers said to him:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you anything in your country so
superior and so much more wonderful
that you could tell about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Waal, I just have,” drawled the Yankee.
“There’s hundreds of more wonderful
things over in Ameriky that we
don’t pay no heed to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you mean Niagara Falls and the
Mammoth Cave and such things?” said
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pshaw! We don’t count caves, nor
waterfalls, nor burning mountains, nor
boiling springs, though we can beat creation
in such things. Say, did any of you
fellows hear of the petrified forest in
Arizony?—hundreds of thousands of acres
of stone forests!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And the trees standing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The trees standing? Waal, I should
say so; and not only standing, but all in
leaf and some of ’em in blossom, and
others, again, full of nuts and other fruit,
all turned into stone, mind you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I suppose there were birds in the
trees?” sneered one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Birds! Yes, sir, no end of birds, all
of the most beautiful plumage and all
turned into stone. Even the nests in the
trees and the eggs in them were petrified
in the most wonderful manner you
ever saw. I see some of you fellows
doubt me. Waal, all I have to say is that
what I am telling you is true, and I’ll
bet any sum on it and take you there
to prove it. I’ll tell you what I saw last
time I was in the petrified forest. There
was a hunter who must have been in the
forest when the petrification took place,
for he was petrified, too, and there he
stood as straight as you please, with a
petrified gun on his shoulder a-taking aim
at a petrified bird. Why, the whole thing
was so natural that you could see the
shot and smoke coming out of the muzzle
of the——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ve got you there!” interrupted the
Englishman. “The law of gravitation
would have brought down the smoke and
the shot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So it would,” said the Yankee, “but
the funny thing about it was that the law
of gravitation was petrified, too, and so
the blamed thing could not work.”—<cite>Tit-Bits.</cite></p>

very early one morning. The latter,
although much surprised at receiving
such an early call, did not forget his hospitality.</p>

said cordially.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I don’t know’s I ought,’ said Jake,

</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'><b>WHY</b> was the sandwich so called?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> the Earl of Sandwich
(1718—1792) on one occasion, not wishing
to leave his place at the gaming-table,
called a waiter and ordered some slices
of bread with ham between them to be
brought to him, so that he could go on
playing without interruption. To this
combination his friends gave his name.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> is a certain kind of paper called
“foolscap”?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> Oliver Cromwell substituted
a fool’s cap and bells in water-mark for
the royal arms granted by Charles I
with certain privileges in manufacturing
paper. When the “Rump” Parliament
was prorogued this water-mark was removed,
but the paper of the size of the
Parliamentary Journal, seventeen by
fourteen inches, still bears the name.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> are elephants afraid of mice?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> mice strongly resemble a
little animal known as the chacana,
which feeds on a small berry especially
liked by the elephant. Chacanas live in
the ground after the manner of prairie-dogs,
under the bushes, and are often
trampled upon by elephants. In their
fright the little animals run up the tubes
of the elephants’ trunks, their long, sharp
claws catch in the flesh, and they cannot
be ejected. An agonizing death is almost
invariably the consequence to the elephant.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> is noon the traditional and fashionable
hour for wedding ceremonies?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> the hour became the customary
one in England many years since,
for the reason that the bridegroom could
not be relied upon to be sober any later
in the day than twelve o’clock. It was
naturally desirable that he should be responsible
for his promises, and unless he
was in a state of perfect sobriety this
could not be. Hence the precaution of a
noonday wedding.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> is the first period of married life
known as “the honeymoon”?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> of an ancient custom in the
northern nations of Europe. The bride
and bridegroom, for a month after the
wedding, drank a wine made from honey
as their principal form of nourishment.
It was called the honey-month or moon.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> is the fee given to a servant
called a “tip”?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> the letters which compose
the word are the initials of “to insure
promptness,” an inscription on the money
boxes which used to be in every tavern.
Into these the traveler dropped his coin,
and the staff, as a whole, shared the
benefit. This custom still prevails in
some places, but in the United States we
give the fee to the particular individual
who serves us.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> do we say “Uncle Sam” when
referring to the United States?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> the initials “U. S.” were
once believed by a few workmen to refer
to “Uncle Sam” Wilson who was government
inspector, at Troy, in 1812. When
the war began, Elbert Anderson, a New
York contractor, bought a large quantity
of beef, pork, and pickles for the army.
These were inspected by Wilson and
marked E. A., U. S., meaning Elbert
Anderson, for the United States. After
discovering that the letters did not apply
to Wilson, the men still kept up the
“Uncle Sam” as a joke. These same
men carried it into the army and from
there it got into print. From that time
the term has been used for the United
States.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> do we speak of the “near” and
“off” horse?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> in the days when the driver
walked beside the horses his position was
always at the left, with his right arm next
the team. Therefore, in driving a pair,
the horse on the left was nearer than the
one on the right. The “near” horse is
always the one on the left.</p>

<hr class='c027'>

<p class='c013'><b>WHY</b> do the stars twinkle?</p>

<p class='c013'><b>BECAUSE</b> their light passes through
variously heated and moving currents of
air which act as a refractor. Much
twinkling foretells bad weather, because
it denotes that these aerial currents are
more disturbed than usual.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>TRADITIONAL TOMB OF MOTHER OF HUMAN RACE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>MOHAMMEDANS ITS CUSTODIANS.</div>
    <div class='c011'>It is in Arabia, and Bedouins Are the Most Regular Visitors to the Mosque Above It.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The tomb of Eve, the mother of the
human race, is located, according
to tradition, not far from the
burial place of Mohammed, on the Arabian
coast of the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every year, as the sacred season of the
Hejaz comes around, hundreds of thousands
of devout Mohammedans disembark
at the little harbor of Jiddah intent
on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Journeying
with these, a correspondent of the New
York <cite>Herald</cite> made the trip across the
Red Sea from Suakim to the shrine venerated
by Christian and Islamite alike—the
legendary tomb of the first woman.
He writes of it as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>The country presents a very sterile appearance,
there being but little vegetation.
A few date palms are dotted about,
and away to the west, in the direction of
Mecca, groups of stunted acacia-trees
render the prospect less barren. The approach
to the tomb is up a sandy slope,
rising about two hundred feet above the
town.</p>

<p class='c015'>The grave itself is one hundred and
sixty feet long and five feet wide, and
is surrounded by a stone wall four feet
high, covered with chunam. In the center
of it rises a small dome-crowned
mosque, wherein pilgrims assemble to say
their prayers. The mosque is in charge
of some dervishes, who have plenty to do
in keeping it clear of the crowds of beggars
who assemble and clamor for backsheesh.</p>

<p class='c015'>Inside the mosque is perfectly plain,
except that in the center is erected an
altar. This stands about three feet high,
and is covered with curtains. The curtains
being drawn aside, disclose a black
stone let into the floor.</p>

<p class='c015'>This stone is supposed to lie directly
over the tomb of Eve, and is polished
like marble by the kisses of the faithful.
It is by no means permitted to every pilgrim
to place his lips on this sacred spot,
but by a liberal amount of backsheesh
and the presence of the consular kavasses
I was permitted the honor, and,
accordingly, the curtain was drawn, and
on hands and knees I paid homage to our
legendary mother.</p>

<p class='c015'>The stone which is treated with so
much honor is a very curious one, evidently
meteoric, and is supposed, like the
Kaaba at Mecca, to have been specially
sent down from heaven for its present
use.</p>

<p class='c015'>I had a long chat with the chief custodian
of the tomb, who told me that the
office had been in the family for generations.
He said that the most regular
visitors to the shrine are the Bedouins,
who, in their yearly wanderings through
the Arabian desert, rarely fail to visit
Eve’s tomb. I asked him if there was
any legend as to why Eve was supposed
to be buried there, but he knew none, and
asked:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Where else would she be buried except
on this sacred soil?”</p>

<p class='c015'>It is certainly curious that legendary
lore should select spots so distant from
each other for the graves of our first
parents. While Eve rests on the shores
of the Red Sea, Adam is popularly supposed
to lie buried under the forest-clad

<h3 class='c016'>HOW WE MARK OUR NORTHERN BOUNDARIES.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>IRON PILLARS SET IN WILDERNESS.</div>
    <div class='c011'>Mounds of Earth, Granite Shafts, and Metal Tablets Also Indicate Southern Limit of British Territory.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Nearly all the boundaries of the
United States are formed by the
easy, irregular lines of waterways.
The artificial marking of a country the
size of this would seem a gigantic task,
and fortunately it was not necessary all
the way around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along the northwestern border, however,
there is a vast distance where something
of the sort was required, although
it is doubtful if many persons have ever
heard of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A glance at the map of the United
States shows that its boundary adjoining
Canada follows, the larger part of the
distance, an irregular water-line formed
by the Great Lakes and their outlets.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thence from the Lake of the Woods,
on the north of Minnesota, a more direct
course is taken through the wilderness
and over the mountains of the wild West
to the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p class='c015'>This boundary between the countries is
marked at regular intervals by pillars of
wood and iron, earth mounds, or stone
cairns.</p>

<p class='c015'>Beginning at the Lake of the Woods,
cast iron pillars have been placed alternately
by the English and our government,
one mile apart, until reaching the
Red Valley River.</p>

<p class='c015'>Those set by our neighbor were
brought from over the ocean, while ours
were made in Detroit. They are a hollow
casting of a pyramidal form, eight feet in
height, having a base eight inches square
and octagon flange one inch in thickness,
with a top four inches square, surmounted
by a solid cap.</p>

<p class='c015'>Into these hollow posts are fitted well-seasoned
cedar joists, with spikes driven
through apertures made for that purpose
in the casting. One-half of the length of
the pillars are firmly imbedded in the
ground, so that the inscriptions on their
sides, in raised letters two inches high,
face the north and south, the first reading,
“Convention of London,” the latter
“October 20th, 1818.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Beyond the Red River, earth mounds
and stone cairns, seven feet by eight,
generally denote the boundary line.
Whenever wooden posts are used, they
are of the same height as the iron pillars
and painted red above the ground.</p>

<p class='c015'>Through forests a clearing has been
made a rod wide, so that the course is
plainly indicated. Where bodies of water
are crossed, monuments of stone have
been raised several feet above high tide.</p>

<p class='c015'>Over the mountains, shafts of granite,
like grim sentinels, guard the way. Altogether
the fixing of the boundary marks
was expensive, but it was well done.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>WHAT IT COSTS FOR ROYALTY TO BE ILL.</h3>

    <div>PHYSICIANS CHARGE LARGE FEES.</div>
    <div class='c011'>More Than One Hundred Thousand Dollars Divided Among Medical Men Who Attended King Edward.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>That old bugbear, the doctor’s bill,
is really something worth while—to
the doctor—when the patient
happens to be a king. Of all the things
a man has to pay, there is probably
nothing he really grudges quite as much
as this.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let the ordinary mortal take heart,
however, after reading the fees which
royalty pays—and presumably pays
without a murmur.</p>

<p class='c014'>For his four weeks’ attendance at Sandringham,
prior to the recovery of the
king from typhoid fever, in 1871, Sir
William Gull received fifty thousand
dollars. Twice this amount was paid to
Sir Morell Mackenzie for his treatment
of the late Emperor Frederick.</p>

<p class='c015'>The doctors who attended Queen Victoria
in her last illness received two
thousand guineas each; while Dr. Lapponi’s
skill in removing a cyst from the
Pope’s side a few years ago was recompensed
with two thousand five hundred
dollars. Dr. Dinsdale, for his journey to
Saint Petersburg and vaccination of the
Empress Catharine II, received fifty
thousand dollars as his fee, twenty-five
thousand dollars for traveling expenses,
and a life pension of two thousand five
hundred dollars a year.</p>

<p class='c015'>The fees of the physicians who attended
King Edward during the illness which
preceded his coronation amounted to more
than one hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BEFORE THE FORK WAS THOUGHT OF.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>FINGERS DID WORK THOROUGHLY.</div>
    <div class='c011'>The Elegance of Dinner Parties and the</div>
    <div>Daintiness of the Hands Must Have</div>
    <div>Suffered Considerably, However.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Fingers were made before forks
and used instead of forks until a
comparatively recent period; indeed
it is evident that forks have not
even now superseded them altogether,
though there is no doubt about there
being a great improvement in the manner
of eating since the days when the fork
was unknown.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Greeks and Romans, as well as
other ancient nations, knew nothing of
any such implement, and meat was commonly
prepared in stews. Eating was
hardly a dainty operation under such
circumstances, and we should probably
find ourselves overcome with disgust if
we were obliged to take a meal in the
company of our ancestors of even three
hundred years ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>Each man had his own knife, and at dinner
seized the joint with his hand and
cut off what he wished. The dish was
then passed on to the next, who did the
same. The knife then cut up the portions
into small pieces, which were put
into the mouth by the fingers of the hand
unoccupied by the knife.</p>

<p class='c015'>In many parts of Spain, at present,
drinking-glasses, spoons, and forks are
rarities; and in taverns in many countries,
particularly in some towns in
France, knives are not placed on the
table, because it is expected that each
person has one of his own—a custom
which the French seem to have retained
from the old Gauls; but, as no person
will any longer eat without forks, landlords
are obliged to furnish these together
with plates and spoons.</p>

<p class='c015'>None of the sovereigns of England had
forks till the reign of Henry VIII. All,
high and low, used their fingers. Hence
in the royal household there was a dignitary
called the ewery, who, with a set
of subordinates, attended at the meals
with basins, water, and towels. The office
of the ewery survived after forks
came partially into fashion.</p>

<p class='c015'>About the first royal personage who is
known to have had a fork was Queen
Elizabeth; but, although several were
presented to her, it is doubtful whether
she used them on ordinary occasions.</p>

<p class='c015'>Forks were employed only by the
higher classes in the middle of the seventeenth
century. About the period of
the Revolution (1688) few English noblemen
had more than a dozen forks of silver,
along with a few of iron or steel. At
length, for general use steel forks became
an article of manufacture at Sheffield. At
first they had but two prongs; and it was
only in later times that the three-pronged
kind were made. As late as the early
part of the eighteenth century table-forks
were kept on so small a scale by the country
inns in Scotland (and perhaps in some
parts of England) that it was customary
for gentlemen traveling to carry with
them a portable knife and fork in a
shagreen case. The general introduction
of silver forks into Great Britain is quite
recent. It can be dated no further back
than the termination of the French War
in 1814.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>WHY AN OLD STORY IS CALLED A “CHESTNUT.”</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>PHRASE ORIGINATED ON STAGE.</div>
    <div class='c011'>According to Joseph Jefferson, It Was</div>
    <div>First Used In the Old Melodrama,</div>
    <div>“The Broken Sword.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The reason why a hoary old joke
should be a “chestnut,” instead
of a butternut or a hickory nut,
may have puzzled some persons who have
used the word.</p>

<p class='c013'>The late Joseph Jefferson gave the
following account of the origin of the
term, and this explanation may be relied
upon, for the famous actor was an excellent
authority on subjects on which
he spoke and wrote:</p>

<p class='c014'>In an old melodrama by William Dillon,
called “The Broken Sword,” are two
parts—<i>Count Xavier</i> and his servant
<i>Pablo</i>. The Count is a sort of Münchausen,
fond of telling stories of his exploits.
He tells one:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Once I entered the forests of Colloway,
when suddenly, from the boughs of
a cork-tree——’</p>

<p class='c015'>“Chestnut, count,” interrupted Pablo.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Cork-tree,” said the count.</p>

<p class='c015'>“A chestnut,” reiterated Pablo. “I
should know as well as you, for I have
heard you tell the story twenty-seven
times.”</p>

<p class='c015'>William Warren, who had played <i>Pablo</i>
often, was at a men’s dinner once when
a gentleman told a story whose age and
originality were far beyond any doubt.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Chestnut,” murmured Warren. “I
should know as well as you, for I have
heard you tell it twenty-seven times.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The guests took up the expression, and
from that I believe comes the origin of
the term.</p>

    <div>MARVELOUS LIKENESS OF TWINS.</div>
    <div class='c011'>Some Cases of Mistaken Identity, Which</div>
    <div>Involved Their Victims and Others</div>
    <div>in Complications.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The cases of mistaken identity which
occur in real life are only another
proof of the old adage that “truth
is stranger than fiction.” Even Shakespeare,
in his “Comedy of Errors,”
stretching the probabilities to the utmost
limit with the twin brothers and their
twin servants, did not equal the facts in
a marriage celebrated not long since in
Paris.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two bridegrooms, so exactly alike as to
be indistinguishable from each other except
by differences in attire, and two
brides of whom exactly the same was
true, were attended by two “best men”
who were modern dromios.</p>

<p class='c015'>Alphonse and Gabriel Chanteau, the
bridegrooms, were distinguished from
each other in their twin babyhood by
means of a pink ribbon tied around the
arm of Alphonse. Now that they have
reached man’s estate Alphonse wears a
red waistcoat and Gabriel a white one.</p>

<p class='c015'>Genevieve and Susanne Renaud, twin
sisters who have become Mesdames
Chanteau, are living realizations of
<i>Girofle-Girofla</i> in the French comic opera
of that name. Their differentiation in the
eyes of their friends is accomplished by
the aid of Genevieve’s red corsage and the
white one worn by Susanne.</p>

<p class='c015'>As to the grooms’ “best men,” Gustave
and Maurice Freunzer, also twins,
who are cousins of the Messrs. Chanteau,
they are as much alike as the
proverbial two peas.</p>

<p class='c015'>Knowing their marvelous resemblance,
these twins will undoubtedly keep themselves
happily “sorted out”; but the case
of a woman in Vienna who was imposed
upon to the extent of actually marrying
the wrong man has the element of tragedy
rather than comedy.</p>

<p class='c015'>This woman, who was of the lower
middle class, married a man whom she
took to be Herr Weiss, her fiancé, returning
from a year’s absence in America to
make her his wife. In less than a month
he robbed her of her savings and then
suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p class='c015'>A month later she received a letter
from America regretting that the writer
had been too ill to return at the time
agreed, but stating that he was about to
sail, and that immediately on his arrival
would fulfil his promise by leading her
to the altar. The letter was signed
“Herrmann Weiss.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The poor woman’s worst fears were
realized when, on her correspondent’s
arrival, she recognized that she had been
victimized by an impostor. It subsequently
transpired that the genuine Herrmann
Weiss had, while in America, foregathered
with his double, who had ascertained
sufficient of the former’s history
and prospects to enable him to carry out
with success his scheme of deception and
robbery.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Claude Bonnat, a baker of Marseilles,
was in hiding from the police, who
held a warrant for his arrest on a serious
charge, he managed to communicate with
an acquaintance, one Leriot, who in every
respect was his exact double, and conjured
him, on the strength of their old friendship,
to promise that, should any misfortune
befall him, he would by impersonating
him keep from the young woman to
whom he was engaged the knowledge of
her lover’s shame. Leriot gave his promise,
which sat but lightly on his conscience,
as one to be kept or broken as
whim might direct.</p>

<p class='c015'>However, when Bonnat a day or two
later fell into the hands of justice, Leriot
sought out the young woman, of whom he
had no previous knowledge, with the result
that his susceptible heart was so
touched that he entered into the fulfilment
of his promise with surprising zeal.
So well, indeed, did he enact the rôle of
Bonnat that he in a short while espoused
the latter’s fiancée. The couple led a life
of complex happiness, which was in no
wise dimmed when, some years later, on
the convict’s release, the wife first discovered
the fraud of which she had been
the victim.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>SHORTHAND IS MORE THAN 2,000 YEARS OLD.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>USED AT THE TRIAL OF CATILINE.</div>
    <div class='c011'>Development of the System Was Due</div>
    <div>Especially to Tiro, a Slave, in the</div>
    <div>First Century B.C.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Shorthand is so closely associated
with the hurry and rush of
modern business that it is startling
to think of it having been in use among
the ancient Greeks and Romans. Yet
there seems to be no doubt that the orations
of Cicero were committed to paper
with as much skill and rapidity as the
modern stenographer can boast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just how old the system of abbreviated
writing is which the ancient Greeks
called tachygraphy, it is impossible to
say. Xenophon is believed to have used
it in taking notes of the lectures of Socrates,
which would take it back to the
fifth century before Christ. This is disputed
by some authorities, but there
seems to be no doubt about its use in the
first century. A writer in the Chicago
<cite>Tribune</cite> gives some interesting facts
about it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The development of shorthand was
due especially to Marcus Tullius Tiro.
Born in Latium in 103 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, Tiro, who was
a slave, was brought up with Cicero, who
was some years his junior. Freed, he
became Cicero’s secretary, and in this
capacity aided him greatly. In the famous
trial of Catiline (63 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) the stenographic
rapidity of Tiro was at its height.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the first century before Christ a discourse
of Cato Uticensis, according to
Plutarch, was taken down by shorthand
reporters.</p>

<p class='c015'>Early in the third century Anno
Domino is found the term semeiograph
(stenographic character), used by the
Greek orator, Flavius Philostratus.</p>

<p class='c015'>Origen, of Alexandria (185–254 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>),
noted his sermons down in shorthand,
and Socrates, the ecclesiastical historian
of the fourth century, said that parts of
the sermons of St. John Chrysostom were
preserved by the same process.</p>

<p class='c015'>The shorthand that they used was a
form of writing in which each word was
represented by a special sign. The letters
of the alphabet, with modifications, connected
so as to admit of great rapidity
of execution, formed the elements of these
characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Manilius, who was a contemporary of
Cicero, Vergil, and Horace, mentions it
in verse. He says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c019'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>And while the willing hand its aid affords,</div>
      <div class='line'>Prevents the tongue to fix the falling words.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The greatest things of the world reduced

them, do not seem great at all.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sum of all the money on earth
would be made up of just so many pennies,
and a penny is an insignificant coin.
In just the same way the distance around
the earth is very great, yet it is numbered
in miles, and a mile is not much of a
walk.</p>

<p class='c014'>For instance, how far will a man walk
in a lifetime? It is a little difficult to fix
the average mileage per day of the average
man. Some men are fond of walking.
Others ride a bicycle or patronize the
trolley-cars. But it is safe to say that
every man walks two miles a day, if only
in stirring about his room or office.</p>

<p class='c015'>If a man lives to be thirty years old he
will walk twenty-one thousand nine hundred
miles. The three-miles-a-day man
will cover thirty-two thousand eight hundred
and fifty. The man who believes
in a daily constitutional of five miles
will walk fifty-four thousand seven hundred
and fifty miles. The circumference
of the earth is twenty-four thousand eight
hundred and ninety-nine miles. If a man
walks two miles a day he will find, after
he has walked for thirty years, he would
still have some distance to walk in order
to complete the circuit of the globe.</p>

<p class='c015'>Walking three miles a day he will go
around the world once and have a neat
margin besides. The five-miles-a-day man
will walk around twice and have a few
thousand-odd miles to his credit.</p>

<p class='c015'>At forty this man will have made three
trips, and at sixty his pedometer will indicate
one hundred and nine thousand
five hundred miles, which means that he
will have walked around the earth four
times and he will still have about two
thousand miles to the good on the fifth
trip.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Custom and usage have made the
misapplication of some words so
familiar that they have lost their
original meaning and now signify quite
the opposite. The word “slave,” for instance,
is a striking example of this fact.
The Slavi were a tribe which once dwelt
on the banks of the Dneiper and derived
their name from “slav,” which means
noble or illustrious. In the later days of
the Roman Empire vast numbers of them
spread over Europe in the condition of
captive servants, and the name of the
tribe came to mean the lowest state of
servitude—the very antithesis of its original
sense.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of our commonest expressions

<p class='c013'>And so, I say it most confidently, the first intellectual task of our age is rightly
to order and make serviceable the vast realm of printed material which four
centuries have swept across our path. To organize our knowledge, to
systematize our reading, to save, out of the relentless cataract of ink, the immortal
thoughts of the greatest—this is a necessity unless the productive ingenuity
of man is to lead us at last to a measureless and pathless chaos. To know anything
that turns up is in the infinity of knowledge to know nothing. To read the
first book we come across in the wilderness of books is to learn nothing. To turn

Two of its most distinguished members—the
Counts Eugene and Octavius, both of
them Privy Councilors of the Emperor
and Knights of the Golden Fleece—married
domestic servants, Eugene taking his
wife from the laundry, while the Countess
Octavius Kinsky was formerly the chambermaid
at a small inn.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Countess Octavius has rendered
herself very obnoxious to her husband’s
family by her grasping propensities. But
the late Countess Eugene, the ex-washerwoman
of Ischal, was a singularly charming
woman, universally beloved at Vienna,
and, although she never asked for a presentation
at court, the names of quite a
number of members of the imperial family
figured on her visiting list.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Lady Hawkins Was a Cook.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The widowed Princess Alexander of
Battenberg, whose husband at one time
ruled over Bulgaria, may likewise be said
to have sprung from the kitchen, her
father having been the valet and her
mother the cook of the old Austrian General
de Martini. Yet in spite of this
parentage, Princess Alexander is treated
as a sister-in-law by the similarly widowed
Princess Henry of Battenberg, who is a
daughter of Queen Victoria. The late
queen showed great kindness and consideration
toward Princess Alexander of Battenberg,
acknowledging her as a kinswoman.</p>

<p class='c015'>The second wife of the late Lord Bramwell
had originally been his cook, while
Lady Hawkins, who is the better half of
the eminent English judge of that name,
and the aunt by marriage of “Anthony
Hope,” the novelist, was originally a
housemaid, as was also the widow of the
“Grand Old Man” of Australia, Sir Henry
Parkes.</p>

<p class='c015'>King Joachim of Naples, from whom
the entire princely house of Murat is descended,
began life at the close of the last
century as a mere stable-boy, while the
first Prince Kutusoff, founder of the grand
Russian family of that name, achieved his
greatness a hundred years ago by the
skill which he displayed as the valet and
barber to Czar Paul, a monarch whose
own great-grandmother, Empress Catherine,
was the chambermaid of a village inn,
where she first attracted the attention of
Peter the Great, who ultimately married
her.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Earl Served as Porter.</h3>

<p class='c017'>That the prejudice which formerly existed
in exalted circles against menial
occupation is rapidly disappearing is
abundantly proved by the number of titled
personages who are content to take at
meal-time their place, not at the table of
the master of the house, but at that of
the domestics in the servants’ hall.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus in the course of a civil suit against
Sir Charles Nugent it came out that he
was earning his livelihood as a groom,
while Lady Nugent was taking in washing.
Yet the Nugents are among the
most ancient and illustrious of all the
grand houses of the nobility of Europe,
some of their members being princes of
the Austrian Empire, while the head of
the family is the Earl of Westmeath.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here in this country Lord Drummond,
the grandson and heir of the British Earl
of Perth and the French Duke of Melfort,
died several years ago while occupying
a menial position—that of door-porter
in the establishment of one of
the proprietors of the great New York
daily newspapers; and the writer can remember
having found, a few years ago,
Prince Benjamin Rohan, who by virtue of
his birth is the titular cousin of every
crowned head in Europe, and is descended
in a direct line from Godfrey, Duke of
Bouillon, leader of the First Crusade, and
the first Crusader King of Jerusalem,
serving as a waiter in one of the smaller
restaurants in Second Avenue, New York
City.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir Thomas Echlin, head of the ancient
house of Echlins, which has been settled
in Ireland since the reign of King James
I, and whose baronetcy is nearly three
hundred years old, recently was employed
on the Dublin police force in the humble
capacity of an ordinary “bobby” at six
dollars a week, and was formerly footman
in a London family.</p>

<p class='c015'>One of the last things that Lord Beaconsfield
did before his death was to obtain
from the queen a pension of five
hundred dollars a year for the widow of
the late Lord Kingsland, whom, in spite
of her rank as a peeress of the realm, he
had discovered earning a bare living as a
washerwoman in a large family at Kensington.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lord Kingsland, prior to his accession
to this ancient peerage, had been a
waiter in a Dublin hotel, but on becoming
a lord, through the death of his uncle,
abandoned this calling and preferred to
rely upon his wife’s earnings at the washtub.</p>

<hr class='c028'>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='under'>Happiness.</span></div>

<p class='c013'>Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally.
Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild goose
chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we
may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it, but likely
enough it is gone the moment we say to ourselves, “Here it is!” like the chest
of gold that treasure-seekers find.... There is something more awful in
happiness than in sorrow,—the latter being earthly and finite, the former composed
of the substance and texture of eternity, so that spirits still embodied
may well tremble at it.—Nathaniel Hawthorne.</p>

<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>In the Matter of Tonnage the United States Occupies Fourth Place on the List, Being More Than a Million and a Quarter Tons Behind Great Britain—Ships Now Building Will Give Us Third Place.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The navies of the world represent a
tremendous amount of money as
well as power. It now seems to be
generally admitted that being prepared
for war is the best way of insuring peace.
If this is true, there would seem to be
very little likelihood of war among any
of the great nations of the world. They
are all pretty well prepared to back
up any arguments which they may find
themselves forced into by a display of
force.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our own latest appropriation includes
thirteen and a quarter millions of dollars
for a battle-ship and three torpedo-boat-destroyers,
with a million’s worth of
“subsurface, submersible or submarine
boats.” The battle-ship is to be of the
British Dreadnaught class—a monster of
nineteen thousand tons displacement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Japan is building one of thirteen
thousand one hundred and fifty tons, and
Germany has increased the tonnage of
some of her ships heretofore authorized
to eighteen thousand each.</p>

<p class='c013'>Commenting upon this the New York
<cite>Sun</cite> says:</p>

<p class='c014'>The Russian-Japanese War convinced
the naval experts of the world that the
big battle-ship must be the principal
weapon of marine combatants, and the
effects of the lesson may be seen wherever
national ships are building.</p>

<p class='c015'>Leaving out of consideration all vessels
more than twenty years old, except such
as have been rebuilt or rearmed, all

<p class='c015'>Were the vessels now in course of construction
all completed, the order in
which the powers stand in this table
would be changed by the transposition of
the positions of Germany and the United
States and of those occupied by Russia
and Italy.</p>

<p class='c015'>Comparing the personnel of these navies,
it is shown that the United States,
with one thousand three hundred and
seventy commissioned officers of all
ranks in the sea-going corps, has actually
fewer than any power except Austria,
which has eight hundred and fifty-one,
and in proportion to tonnage stands at
the bottom of the list, having only 1.95
commissioned officers to each one thousand
tons of her war-ship tonnage built
and building.</p>

<p class='c015'>Great Britain has 2.52 officers to every
one thousand tons, France 3.58, Germany
3.48, Italy 4.60, and Austria 5.91. It is
not practicable to give the proportions
for Russia and Japan, owing to the conditions
created by their recent struggle.</p>

<p class='c015'>In midshipmen and cadets the United
States leads all the nations save Great
Britain, both absolutely and relatively,
with one thousand and fifty-four in the
service, or 1.49 to each one thousand
tons.</p>

<p class='c015'>In nothing is the tremendous size of
the British navy shown more impressively
than the figures of her enlisted men.
Of these, exclusive of marines, she has
ninety-five thousand two hundred and
sixty-three, but there are only 49.93 men
to each one thousand tons, while the
United States with thirty-seven thousand
men has 52.70, Germany with thirty-five
thousand one hundred and thirteen has
59.71, and France with fifty-two thousand
one hundred and fifty-three has 65.10.</p>

<p class='c015'>Great Britain and the United States
are the only powers that maintain
aboard ship enlisted men other than
bluejackets, and it is the intention of
Great Britain to replace all her marine
officers gradually by naval officers. No
navy has a grade corresponding exactly
to the British and American warrant
officer, the nearest approximation of it
being the chief petty officers of the other
navies.</p>

<p class='c015'>The United States has no engineer
corps, and Great Britain is amalgamating
her engineer corps with the line. The
other nations all maintain the distinction
which existed in our navy until the adoption
of the Roosevelt personnel law.</p>

<p class='c015'>Neither Japan nor Italy maintains
chaplains, and many British chaplains
are naval instructors.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>NIX’S MATE LIGHT IN BOSTON HARBOR.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>The Story of an Island Which Disappeared and the Curious Old Legend of the Spot Now Marked by This Interesting Beacon.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>As a person enters Boston Harbor by
the main ship channel, having
threaded his way between Lovell’s Island
and Gallup’s Island, and just before
passing between Long Island and Deer
Island, he sees at his left a unique
monument marking a dangerous ledge
and shoal. So peculiar is its appearance
that every stranger is sure to ask, “What
is that?” To this some local wiseacre
promptly responds, “Nix’s Mate”; but
usually he cannot explain its meaning
or even spell the name correctly.</p>

<p class='c014'>The “Mate” is a massive piece of copper-riveted
masonry, forty feet square
and twelve feet high (with stairs on one
side), upon whose top rises a black
wooden pyramid, twenty feet high. Two
hundred years ago, where this weird pyramid
now stands, there was a fertile island
of twelve acres, furnishing excellent grazing,
and called, in consequence, Green
Island. So much is history. A curious
old book, long out of print,<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c024'><sup>[4]</sup></a> has woven
the legend of the name into a pleasing
romance, which in brief is as follows:</p>

<div class='footnote c026' id='f4'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Nix’s Mate: an Historical Romance of America,
by the author of “Athenia of Damascus,” etc. In
two volumes. Published by Samuel Colman, No.
VIII Astor House, Broadway, 1839.</p>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When Sir William Phips made his
celebrated expedition to the Spanish
Main in 1687, under the auspices of the
Duke of Albemarle, in which he recovered
some millions of sunken gold and enriched
himself for life, he was accompanied
by one Captain Nix and his first
mate, Edward Fitzvassal. As the first
expedition was so wonderfully successful,
Captain Nix went out on another search
and raised another precious cargo from
the bottom of the deep. But on his return
the crew of his vessel, the Dolphin,
mutinied, under the leadership of the
mate, and turned pirates.</p>

<p class='c015'>Captain Nix and six others were set
adrift early in the year 1689, in an open
boat, and left to their fate. After incredible
hardships they reached land, only to
be captured by savages. Toward spring
they escaped in a canoe, and finally landed
on Green Island, June 1, 1689. They contrived
to reach Boston Town, and there
they found the Dolphin and Fitzvassal,
too, who had assumed the name of Captain
Nix. Fitzvassal was tried for piracy,
convicted, and sentenced to be executed
on Green Island on June 5. But for some
service which he had rendered to the
colony while bearing his assumed name
he was pardoned by the governor (Bradstreet).
Before the news of the pardon
reached him, however, he took a fatal dose
of poison.</p>

<p class='c015'>He was buried on Green Island, and his
sole mourner was an Indian maid and
sibyl who had loved him. She prophesied
that the island would wash away, and her
prediction was fulfilled: little by little, the
earth slid off the rock into the sea, and
now nothing remains but a dangerous
ledge upon which stands the curious beacon—Nix’s
Mate.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Achievements of Famous Invalids.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Some of the Most Distinguished Workers in the Fields of Literature and Music Have Won Their Triumphs While Defying Disease—Many Examples of Extraordinary Longevity.</div>
    <div class='c011'><i>An original article written for</i> <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Ill health and infirmity do not always
prevent the accomplishment of great
things, and the list of invalids who
have been famous for excelling in
their chosen field is long and brilliant.
Naturally such persons usually
have been restricted to the quieter pursuits.
Literature seems to have been the
field wherein most of them have found
congenial occupation, though there have
been great invalids in other professions,
also.</p>

<p class='c013'>The long battle of Robert Louis
Stevenson against the malady which
finally conquered him, is well known to
every one. He traveled about, from
place to place, searching for the spot
where he could hope to live at least long
enough to do some of the work which it
lay in him to do, until, at last, in the
Samoan Islands, in the South Seas, he
found the haven for which he had been
searching. There the heroic struggle
went on for the four last years of his life,
and there he was buried high on the peak
of Mount Væa, above his island home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Probably no famous writer suffered
for a longer period than did Alexander
Pope, who was stricken, when only a
child of ten, with a malady which deformed
his body and robbed him of
health and comeliness, leaving him to
forty-six years of invalidism. His constant
study and work, combined with
this physical infirmity, made his life
“one long disease.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Carlyle, Heine, and Keats.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Thomas Carlyle was a chronic dyspeptic,
and suffered, all his life, the torments
which only those unfortunates, who are
victims of this disease, can comprehend.
The bitterness of some of his writings
which were published after his death
may surely be excused when this is considered,
for the chronic dyspeptic is
generally understood to develop, in spite
of himself, a gloomy view of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Heinrich Heine, the great German
lyric poet, was the victim, during the last
twelve years of his life, of relentless
disease. He bore his dreadful sufferings
so patiently that he appears in a nobler
light than ever before during his life.
His hearing was bad, his sight was dim,
and his legs were paralyzed, yet he wrote
some of his most wonderful songs during
the long watches of sleepless nights,
lying on his “mattress-grave.” He described
his condition as “a grave without
rest, death without the privileges of the
departed,” yet he was never so many-sided
as during this period. He produced
humorous pieces, political songs,
and the tenderest poems. He kept at
his work as long as he could hear and
speak, his last words being “paper and
pencil.”</p>

<p class='c013'>John Keats, while on a tour of
the English Lakes, contracted a throat
trouble which developed into consumption.
He continued to write, though he
failed rapidly in health, and his last
volume contains some of his best poems.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Mrs. Browning and the Brontës.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Elizabeth Barrett Browning was confined
to her room for seven years, but was
restored to something like a normal state
of health before her marriage. The long
period of illness was partly caused by
the death of her brother, of whom she
was extremely fond, and many times her
life was despaired of. She wrote in spite
of sickness, however, and produced some
excellent verse. All her life she struggled
against a naturally weak constitution
and she worked under difficulties.</p>

<p class='c013'>Count Giacomo Leopardi, an Italian
poet, was another whose life from childhood
was made melancholy by impaired
health. In his case it was largely the
result of the energy with which he gave
himself up to study, when he was only a
child, thus undermining an already delicate
constitution. He was the victim
of a perpetual melancholy, and he wandered
to and fro in Italy, always the
prey of ceaseless physical tortures, which
prevented him from accepting any permanent
position that might have relieved
the constant and pressing need of money.
He attained distinction as a philologist
and was offered a university professorship
in Germany by Bunsen, but was unable
to accept it because of his infirmity.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three gifted Brontë sisters were
all in wretched health. Emily and Anne
died within a year of each other, leaving
Charlotte to a lonely life of sorrow and
heartache. She worked on, in spite of
all, with indomitable energy and courage,
and the genius of the woman is all the
more remarkable when one realizes that
her sufferings were both physical and
mental. Her work came from an aching
heart as well as from a weak and ill
body. One short year of happiness was
hers at the end, when she became the
wife of the Rev. Mr. Nicholls, curate
under her father, who had long loved
her.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Parkman and Prescott.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Francis Parkman, the American historian,
is an illustrious example of heroic
perseverance in the face of great difficulties.
He selected as his life work the
writing of the history of the rise and
fall of the French power in America.
He began a most exhaustive research
which carried him west into the Black
Hills, where the hardships he endured
broke down his health and left him a
semi-invalid for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class='c013'>He kept at his appointed task, though
fourteen years elapsed between the first
part of his work and the second. To occupy
the time which his health would
not permit him to devote to the greater
work, he took up the study of horticulture,
in which he grew so proficient that
he published a book on roses and was
made professor of horticulture in the
Harvard Agricultural School.</p>

<p class='c013'>From 1865 to 1892 he brought out the
various parts necessary to complete his
great work. During all of this time,
however, his health was so precarious
that he depended almost entirely upon
dictation instead of his pen, and his
material was collected for him by hired
copyists. The story of his struggle is
regarded as one of the most heroic in
the history of literature.</p>

<p class='c013'>William Hickling Prescott was another
historian whose labors were made difficult
by infirmity. While he was at
Harvard he lost the sight of one eye
by an accident, and the other was so
affected that he was obliged to pass
several months in a darkened room. The
sight was partly restored, but he could
never use it in any trying work, nor more
than a little while each day, and he
suffered constantly with it and from the
apprehension which it occasioned.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the aid of secretaries and readers
he set to work, determined to prepare
himself for literature, as more active
fields were closed to him. He wrote
some himself, in spite of his affliction,
using a writing frame designed especially
for the blind—and he produced work
which placed him in the ranks with the
most brilliant historians.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Famous Musicians and Poets.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Chopin, the great modern master of
pianoforte composition, was unable, because
of lack of physical strength, to play
some of his own works as he would have
them played. A trip to England, of
only eleven days’ duration, was enough
to develop the latent consumption which
was in his family, and from this time on
he worked under the advancing ravages
of the disease, though he lived twelve
years before finally succumbing to its onslaught.
Many times during this period
he was reported at death’s door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Handel became blind seven years before
his death, yet continued his work
and accompanied one of his oratorios
upon the organ only eight days before his
death.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Byron and Sir Walter Scott both
were lame from a deformed foot, but
suffered no inconvenience from the infirmity.
Milton became blind and Beethoven
was deaf from about his thirtieth
year. He faced the pathetic situation
with the brave resolve: “I will grapple
with fate; it shall never drag me down.”
His life was lived along these lines, and
never did his courage falter or his fortitude
give way, though the affliction to a
musician was almost the greatest he
could suffer.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Methuselahs Laughed at Doctors.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Some of the modern Methuselahs have
been persons who were given up by the
doctors to fill an early grave. Surely
this fact, taken in connection with the
many examples that there are of the
great things which invalids have accomplished,
ought to bring the champions of
euthanasia up short. Perhaps it is too
much to expect that anything will stop
the man who is once thoroughly launched
on this delusive line of thought, but for
the sake of the timorous who are not,
perhaps, as rugged in health as the men
who advocate this “simple and humane”
reform, the following examples
of men and women, not famous, who
have attained to a “green old age” in
spite of being in an apparently hopeless
condition, are quoted. They are taken
from a paper written by E. H. Von den
Eynden, of Antwerp, and published
there in 1882, under the title “Singularités
Macrobiologiques”—(Curiosities
of Long Life).</p>

<p class='c014'>Adèle Lambotte died at Liege in 1763,
aged one hundred and one years. She
was scarcely thirty-two inches in height,
and so crippled in her legs and feet that
from infancy she was compelled to walk
on crutches.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1774 there lived at Château Neuf, in
Thimerais, France, a certain demoiselle
Thierree. At the time, she was over
forty years old, and an invalid, forever
taking medicines. A contemporary describes
her graphically thus:</p>

<p class='c015'>“A few tufts of grisly hair, two
squinting eyes, lost in the multitude of
wrinkles and hanging folds of skin that
stood for nose and cheeks, and with a
head in perpetual oscillation.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She lived in the open air, strolling
from point to point in all sorts of wind
and weather. She enjoyed an income
amounting to about one thousand dollars,
and some of her friends made her a
proposition to transfer their property to
her providing she would pay them a certain
annuity and devise the property
back to them at her death.</p>

<p class='c015'>The bargain was made, and faithfully
kept, as far as the annuity was concerned,
yet so skilfully did she manage
affairs that she soon had an income of
two thousand dollars over and above all
expenditures. Her friends meanwhile
imagined that they had made a good
bargain, as her physician had assured
them that she “could never see the return
of the swallows next spring.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The swallows came and went, and
came and went again, and they got impatient,
and in some way the “old mamselle”
found it out. Then she set herself
to live in earnest. She wept for
Louis XVI, lived through and detested
the Revolution, saw the funerals of
Bonaparte and Charles X, and lived
through the barricades of 1830.</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally, in 1835, she died, aged one
hundred and five years, lacking part of a
month. On making an inventory of her
affairs her executor found upward of four
hundred linen chemises, each made with
her own hands, not one of which had
ever been worn. Her revenue, at the
time of her death, was two hundred
thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c015'>The people who made the bargain had
died one after another, the last one more
than forty years before her demise.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Remarkable Centenarians.</h3>

<p class='c017'>In 1699 the Mémoires of the Academy
of Sciences recorded the death of a man,
aged one hundred years, whose spinal
column consisted of one single bone, the
intermediate cartilages having ossified.</p>

<p class='c015'>About the middle of the seventeenth
century there was carried in solemn procession
and hung up before the shrine of
Notre Dame de Liesse an enormous
vesical calculus, on which was engraved
the following legend:</p>

<p class='c015'>“This stone was removed from François
Annibal d’Etrées, duke and peer,
Grand Marshal of France, by the grace
of God through the intercession of the
Blessed Virgin, September 15, 1654.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The grand marshal was eighty-two
years old when the terrible operation was
performed. It gave him a new lease of
life, as he did not die until 1675, more
than twenty years afterward, aged one
hundred and two years and a few
months.</p>

<p class='c015'>A poor girl, daughter of a retainer of
the Château de Colemberg, near Boulogne,
named Nicole Mare, was born
deformed, and, besides having a withered
forearm, was so humpbacked that she
stood less than four feet high. With all
this, she lived to the age of one hundred
and ten years. Her occupation was herding
cattle, and it is said that the only
food she ever tasted was bread and milk.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Sick for One Hundred Years.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The celebrated Fontanelle, who, it is
said, never enjoyed a well day in his
life, and whose constitution was so frail
that the least exposure made him ill, yet
lived within less than one month of one
hundred years.</p>

<p class='c015'>M. Le Fermy, a peasant of the village
of Saint-Justin, near Mont-de-Marsan,
France, died in his native village September
13, 1714, aged one hundred and
ten years and two months. All his life
he was regarded as a feeble man. The
note recording his death says:</p>

<p class='c015'>“He was married five times, <i>although</i>
he lived soberly and was regarded as
weakly.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1760, at Graessans, in the diocese
of Saint-Papoul, France, died a woman
whose age is recorded as one hundred
and thirteen years and one month. She
died of asthma, with which she had suffered
for forty-five years.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Benedictine monk, Brother N.
Graillet, of the Abbey of Calvary, at La
Fère, France, died in the abbey in 1763,
aged one hundred and two years. He had
entered the abbey in his thirtieth year,
in ill-health and disappointed in life.
“For seventy-two years, although always
feeble, he obeyed every rule of the abbey,
and was always first in filling the functions
of the community,” is his record.</p>

<p class='c015'>Pierre Foucault, a native of Abbéville,
died in that place in 1766, aged one hundred
and fifteen years. Up to the age of
fifty his health had been very precarious,
and during the years between fifty and
sixty “he suffered many maladies.”
After that he recovered his usual health
and lived fifty-five years. His father died
aged one hundred and two, and his grandfather
was accidentally killed while
hunting, at the age of eighty-seven.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>Had Many Diseases.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Madame Ristori, probably an ancestress
of the celebrated artiste, died at
Empoi—a village in Tuscany—in 1767,
aged one hundred and ten years. Her
whole life was passed in frightful poverty
and hardship. She was an invalid
nearly her whole life, and had, besides,
almost every disease that can be named,
at one or another period of her existence.</p>

<p class='c015'>Marguerite Couppéc, widow of Richard
Couppéc, died at Rouen in 1769. The
baptismal register at Caux, where she
was born in 1654, shows conclusively that
she was one hundred and fifteen years
old at death. “All her life,” says her
tombstone, “she lived in poverty and illness,
having had many most violent diseases,
notwithstanding which she was
most laborious, being always occupied as
long as her hands could work.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Young Doctor—Do you think the visitor
is really a patient? I am afraid that he
is a creditor.</p>

<p class='c015'>Servant—Well, I heard him groaning.
If he isn’t ill he must have a very big
bill to collect.—<cite>Fliegende Blätter.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>A WELL REGULATED LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Reporter (to old man)—How come you
to be so hale and hearty at ninety?</p>

<p class='c015'>Old Man—Regularity, sir. I have gone
on a spree regularly every Sunday, since
I was twenty. There is nothing like
regularity.—<cite>Fliegende Blätter.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>ON THEIR HONEYMOON.</h3>

<p class='c017'>She—Oh, George, I want all these

<p class='c015'>He—Well, my dear, you had better
carry the dress-suit case and the umbrellas.—<cite>Le
Rire.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>LOVE OF COUNTRY.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Several men were chatting together.
One of them, a Greek, was praising his
country.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Greece,” said he, “is the most beautiful
land in the world. The blue heavens
laugh perennially over Greece.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why, that’s nothing,” said a Hungarian,
“the whole world laughs over
Hungary.”—<cite>Jugend.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE CASE AND THE EXCEPTION.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Doctor (to maid)—I am Dr. Curewell.
They have just telephoned me to come
here immediately. How is the patient?</p>

<p class='c015'>Maid—Oh, doctor, you have arrived
too late! My master died not five minutes
ago.</p>

<p class='c015'>Doctor—Well, never mind. In this
case, at least, nobody can say that I was
the cause of death.—<cite>Le Rire.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>AT THE INTELLIGENCE OFFICE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The Lady—Now, remember, please, I
want a very good maid and one that is
absolutely discreet.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Proprietor—You can be perfectly

She has been five years at a telephone
switch-board.—<cite>Le Sourire.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>AT THE DUMA.</h3>

<p class='c017'>The Delegates—We demand equal
rights, liberty, and absolute pardon for
political offenders.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Czar—Peace, peace, my people!
All of you that are not executed will be
pardoned.</p>

the Little Father.—<cite>Il Fischietto.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>IMPUDENCE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>Peggy—Only to think of it, my dear, we
were entirely alone, and he had the audacity
to kiss me.</p>

<p class='c015'>Lucy—I suppose you were furious;
weren’t you?</p>

<p class='c015'>Peggy—I should say so! I was furious
every single time he did it.—<cite>Le Sourire.</cite></p>

<h3 class='c016'>KEPT HIS PROMISE.</h3>

<p class='c017'>She (weeping)—Five years ago, as a

divorce.</p>

<p class='c015'>He—Well, the past five years have
seemed like an eternity.—<cite>Fliegende Blätter.</cite></p>

<p class='c017'>Father—Do you know, sir, that I actually

<p class='c015'>Suitor—I beg your pardon, sir. The
truth is, I was so frightfully busy at the
time that I failed to notice you. I sincerely
hope you will forgive me.—<cite>Le

<h3 class='c016'>FISHING.</h3>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Bell of Kuang Sai.</h2>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='sc'>By</span> EDWARD W. GILBERT.</div>
    <div class='c011'><i>An original story written for</i> <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>.</div>
    <div class='c011'>“They are ghouls, and their king it is who tolls.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>“Heaven born, forbear
anger; in one little half-hour,
or an hour at most,
the bearers shall be here,
and we will go forward
with the speed of dragons. In the
meantime, I will place a rug for the
Presence to sit upon, and give him fire
that he may drink tobacco.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jarvis assented with a sulky grunt,
tossed Chen, his Chinese runner, a cigar,
and lay on his back smoking and staring
up into the dark hollow of the great bell
suspended on a stone tripod.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After labor it is good to lie at ease
and smoke, especially when the Presence,
who is my father and mother, bestows
such tobacco. If the Heaven Born
desires, I will tell him the tale of the
great bell under which we lie. I have
permission? Thus runs the tale:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kublai-Chan, Lord of the Earth,
desired greatly to leave a memory such
as no other king should ever equal, and
after much thought he called Kuang Sai,
the great artist in all metals, and commanded:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Let there be cast for me a great
bell, such as never earth or heaven saw,
of the finest metal, bossed with angels
and demons, and so great that the sound
thereof shall reach to the utmost border
of my kingdom, that all may hear, and,
hearing, know that in Kambalu reigns
the king, and, knowing, tremble and
obey him.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And Kuang Sai prostrated himself
nine times, and said: ‘My lord wills it,
and it is done.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he called his master metal-workers,
journeymen and apprentices,
and took from the king’s treasury gold
and silver and copper and fine bronze
for the casting, and he took clay and
wax and modeled the bell—great, beautifully
formed; round the lip of it, lilies
and pomegranate; round the body of it,
the angels and devils of air and sound,
with waving hair and garments, like
sound-made flesh; the loops by which it
was to hang, two imperial dragons.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And when all was ready he made the
mold, and his men lit the fires, and for
two days labored they at the melting,
casting into the pot the gold and silver
and copper and fine bronze. And when
it was melted with fervent heat, his
master founder, the strong man, struck
out the plug from the crucible, and let
the red hot metal flow into the mold.
Four days waited the cooling; then they
broke the mold—and the great bell was
flawed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And again he made the mold and
melted the metal, and again cast it, and
again it was flawed. And again and
again, and yet again, and always the
great bell was flawed, and must be
broken and re-melted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then Kuang Sai offered sacrifice to
his gods, and his master metal-workers,
journeymen and apprentices, according
to their several degree, also offered sacrifice
to their gods; and again they cast
it, and again it was flawed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two score times they cast it—and
always the flaw. Kuang Sai grew thin
and pale; he ate not, nor slept; for his
honor laid in that casting—and always
the flaw.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He offered sacrifice to the high gods,
the middle, and the less; to the lords of
earth, air, sea, and sky; to all demons
and rulers of the upper and under
worlds; to gods and godlings. He
prayed in all temples; he gave food and
garments to the poor; he consulted all
priests; he leaked rice and silver to all.
The priests grew fat and sleek; an innumerable
multitude of beggars lay at
the gate of Kuang Sai; and still, when
he cast the bell—the flaw.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And on a day he was summoned to
the footstool of the great Chan. He
made the nine prostrations according to
ritual, and waited; and presently, soft
and low, the great Kublai-Chan spoke
thus:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Kuang Sai, I have given thee all
things to make my bell, yet still thou
hast failed after three score trials, whereby
I am lacking my bell, and my honor
is diminished. If in three more trials
I have not my bell, you shall die the
death of a thousand slices, and your
house and all therein perish by fire. I
have said it. You have my permission
to depart.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kuang Sai departed full of fear.
That night he went to the little Temple
of Forbidden Things, and paid the blind
priest of that temple to call up by name
the powers of air, water, fire, and earth,
and ask which of the lords of all things
he had offended, that he might make his
peace and cast his bell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He sat at the foot of the naked
altar, while the priest cast dust upon his
head and called upon the high gods, the
middle, and the less, by name—each by
his name, title, dignity, and degree. He
called upon all gods of city and field,
of trees and fountains, great and small;
and they answered not. Then he called
on the demons and lords of particular
things, of metals and tools, of trades
and crafts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And when he called on the Lord of
Bells, came the runner of the Lord of
Bells—a demon terrible to behold, red
in color, bristling with hair, short and
broad of stature, squat and paunchy of
figure, long of arm, wide-mouthed, and
having three eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Kuang Sai,’ said he (and his voice
was like the rolling of a great bell),
‘you have made sacrifice to all gods, but
you have forgotten the great Lord of
Bells.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“At the name all the temple gongs
boomed without being struck of hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Therefore is he mocked of his fellows;
and therefore, before he will
suffer you to cast the king’s bell, my
lord demands your most precious treasure.
At the next founding, when the
metal leaps red hot for the casting, bring
your daughter’ (here Kuang Sai cried
aloud and fell down with his face in the
dust of the temple floor) ‘arrayed as a
bride, and before the metal flows give
her to the Lord of Bells; so shall the
casting be good. If not, remember that
the death of a thousand slices is long,
for without this sacrifice never will my
lord suffer you to cast that bell.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he disappeared, making noises
like a bell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kuang Sai went forth, staggering,
and all night he walked and thought;
and at morn he said ‘No,’ and went
to the casting—and again the flaw. And
he sat dumb and motionless and ground
his teeth, and again said ‘No,’ and went
to the casting—and again the flaw.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excellency, all that a man has, down
to his skin, will he give for his life; and
near to me is my shirt, but nearer my
skin; and if the third casting failed he
died in agony and his name was blotted
out. There be men who would have
died, but living among pictures and
statues and singing men and women
does not breed the courage that says
‘Then I can die.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the day of the last casting, what
time the pot bubbled full of red hot metal,
over which floated light clouds of
heat, came Kuang Sai, leading by the
hand his little daughter, Fen Sai, blooming
as a white water-lily, tripping on her
little pearl-embroidered shoes, chattering
and laughing in her father’s face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They came to the scaffold over the
mouth of the great melting-pot, and as
they came the master founder, the strong
man, cried: ‘Master, behold the casting
waits.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And Kuang Sai suddenly caught up
his little daughter and cast her into the
molten metal. Once she cried, very awful
to hear—once, and no more; for or ever
she touched the metal the fierce heat
licked her up as a drop of wine is dried
on a hot stone. And as she fell, one
of her little shoes dropped off onto the
scaffold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘To the casting,’ said Kuang Sai,
and the strong man struck out the plug
of the crucible, and the metal, glowing
red and green and golden, flowed into
the mold. Four days waited they the
cooling, and they broke the mold—and
behold, the great bell, perfect, flawless,
the wonder of the world for ages; the
bell under which we now lie.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And Kublai-Chan said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Let Kuang Sai be clothed in the
imperial yellow; give to him the mandarin’s
crystal button, and write on a
tablet at my palace gate, in letters of
vermilion: “Kuang Sai, the Incomparable
Artificer, Whom the King Delights
to Honor.”’</p>

<p class='c013'>“And they clothed Kuang Sai and
bowed down before him, giving him due
honor according to command.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then masons built the stone pillars
and hung the great bell, and on a day
came Kublai-Chan to ring it for the first
time, and with him, at his right hand,
Kuang Sai, whom he delighted to honor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And when all things were prepared,
Kublai-Chan, the great king, drew back
the striking-beam with all force, and
rang the great bell, and sound came
forth, deep, sweet, and full as the voices
of the gods.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Far, far away spread the circles of
sound, even to the edge of the kingdom.
The multitudes gathered around and fell
down before that voice in rows, as corn
before the reaper. The farmer in the
field heard and fell down before the
voice of the king’s bell. At the edge of
the kingdom the Tatar heard it, and
checked his horse, wondering.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And little by little the sound rippled
down again to silence, but as the sound
died there came a buzzing and whispering
inside the bell, and it grew and grew
sharper and louder, into a second peal—clear,
sharp, cutting the heart like a
knife—the scream of a woman in pain,
fright, and horror beyond measure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Kublai-Chan covered his lips with
his hand, for kings should not be seen
to tremble. His guards, strong men,
red-haired, tigers nourished by blood,
looked on each other with white faces,
and Kuang Sai, in his robes of honor,
crouched and scrabbled in the dirt with
his fingers and whispered and driveled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They led him away, and all his life
long he had no more the light of reason,
but sat and mowed and muttered
and laughed foolishly, except when the
king’s bell rang, and then he would
fall and lie with his mouth in the dust.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Behold! in an auspicious hour here
come the bearers. Shall we walk to
meet them? My tale has eaten up the
waiting. But Heaven Born doubts its
truth. Before we go, I will ring the
great bell for him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Chen caught the suspended beam by
which Chinese bells are rung, swung it,
and struck the shining side of the bell,
and the deep boom echoed over the flat
plain. It was truly a tremendous sound,
and justified the belief that it could be
heard to the confines of the kingdom,
and gradually the rippling circles of
sound died down to silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jarvis, standing with his hands in his
belt, was forming his lips to say, ‘But
where’s the scream?’ when Chen raised
his hand for silence, and then, within
the arch of the great bell, began a buzzing,
like bees—a little sound, like trickling
water or the roaring in a shell; and
this thread of sound grew and gathered
till suddenly there pealed out, full-throated,
the cry of a woman in agony
of body and soul—a sound to dream of
and wake at night with your teeth on
edge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That, excellency,” said Chen, “is
Fen Sai crying for her shoe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Jarvis answered nothing, but he
walked faster toward the coming bearers,
and though the sun was hot on his
back, his bones felt cold.</p>

<p class='c013'>Man could direct his ways by plain reason and support his life by tasteless
food; but God has given us wit, and flavor, and brightness, and laughter,

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>AN IMPRESSIVE POEM INSPIRED BY THE DEFEAT OF THE AUSTRIANS BY THE FRENCH IN DECEMBER, 1800.</div>
  </div>

<div class='c014'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_268.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Thomas Campbell (1777–1844) is one of
those writers who composed many elaborate
works, yet whose fame rests wholly
upon three or four short poems which have
become classic. Among these is “Hohenlinden,”
written immediately after the battle
of that name, fought on December 3,
1800, between the French, under Moreau,
and the Archduke John, in command of the
Austrian army.</p>

<p class='c015'>It was one of the most hotly contested battles of the Napoleonic
wars, and was decided by the valor of Marshal Ney, the
Austrians being routed with a loss of twenty thousand men.
The battle made a profound impression in England, and inspired
Campbell to dash off these stirring lines, which in the speed of
their composition and their martial spirit remind one of Tennyson’s
“Charge of the Light Brigade.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>REMEDIES WORSE THAN DISEASE.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Many Freak Medicines Which Were Used By the Ancients Are Paralleled By Gruesome Compounds That Are Inflicted To-Day on Patients in China and Some Parts of Europe—A Wonderful Lotion for Bald Heads.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The most unsavory concoctions of the
modern pharmacy are as the nectar
of the gods when compared with the
medicines of ancient times. It would
seem that physicians in those days taxed
their ingenuity to its utmost to invent
the gruesome horrors which they prescribed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Certainly the fiends who were usually
supposed to be the cause of sickness
must have been a courageous lot of chaps
if they withstood the doses they were
treated to.</p>

<p class='c014'>What would one think nowadays of a
doctor who prescribed the blood from a
black cat’s tail for skin troubles, live
toads tied behind the ear to stop bleeding,
or powdered spiders as an unfailing remedy
for various diseases?</p>

<p class='c015'>Mayerne, a French physician, who is
said to have numbered among his patients
two French and three English sovereigns—Henry
IV and Louis XIII of France, and
James I, Charles I, and Charles II of England—was
fond of dosing his patients with
“pulverized human bones.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A chief ingredient in his gout powder
consisted of “raspings of a human skull
unburied.” In the composition of his
celebrated “balsam of bats” he employed
“adders, bats, sucking whelps,
earth-worms, hog’s grease, the marrow
of a stag, and the thigh-bone of an ox.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr. Boleyn (of the same family as
Queen Anne Boleyn), a physician in the
reign of Elizabeth, prescribed for a child
suffering under a certain nervous malady,
“a small young mouse roasted.” The
same doctor stated that “snayles broken
from the shelles and sodden in whyte
wyne with oyle and sugar are very holsome,
because they be hoat and moist for
the straightness of the lungs and cold
cough.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Belief in the efficacy of charms and
amulets was once universal with the faculty,
and precious stones were regarded
as sovereign remedies. The hyacinth
and topaz hung about the neck or taken
in drink were certain “to resist sorrow
and recreate the heart.” The sapphire
was “a great enemy to black choler,” and
was believed to “free the mind and mend
manners.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A certain kind of onyx was supposed to
preserve the vigor and good estate of the
whole body. One physician went so far
as to declare that “in the body of a swallow
there is a stone found called chelidonius,
which, if it be lapped in a fair
cloth and tied to the right arm, will cure
lunatics, madmen, and make them amiable
and merry.” Herbs were also in great request,
and daisy-tea was accounted a certain
cure for gout and rheumatism.</p>

<p class='c015'>A formula for hair tonic which is given
in the oldest book on medical practise
now known—a book written at Heliopolis,
where Joseph once served in the house of
Potiphar—is described as a “means for
increasing the growth of the hair, prepared
for Schesch, the mother of Teta,
the King of Upper and Lower Egypt.”
Dogs’ teeth, overripe dates, and asses’
hoofs were carefully cooked in oil and
then grated.</p>

<p class='c015'>As Teta lived before Cheops, this recipe
for hair-oil is older than the great pyramid
at Gizeh, and is supposed to date
back more than six thousand years.</p>

<p class='c015'>Three drops of the blood of an angry
cat gave relief to the epileptic.</p>

<p class='c015'>The heads of venomous serpents have
held an important place in medicine.
A strong broth made from them and
mixed with salt and spices and one hundred
other remedies was employed under
the name of theriac as a cure for every
conceivable disease.</p>

<p class='c015'>Curious survivals of this old belief in
the efficacy of certain reptiles and insects
as cures for human ills occasionally come
to light, even in this advanced age. In
New England, cobweb pills are supposed
to be good for the ague, and in the South
a certain knuckle-bone in a pig’s foot is a
cure for rheumatism, if it be carried in
the pocket or worn suspended from a
string around the neck. The spider-web
pill originated in China, where all species
of insects have certain positive or negative
values in medicine.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the learned physicians of Pekin
it is customary to give two or three
scorpions or spiders to a patient ill of
fever.</p>

<p class='c015'>In Ireland, the peasantry swallow small
spiders alive to effect cures. From these
to the cobweb pill of the New England native
was easy.</p>

<p class='c015'>In Flanders, the live spider is fastened
into the empty shell of a walnut and worn
around the neck of the patient. As the
creature dies, the fever decreases until it
is gone entirely.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among jewels, the ruby was considered
good for derangements of the liver, as
well as for bad eyes.</p>

<p class='c015'>The sapphire and emerald were credited
with properties which rendered them
capable of influencing ophthalmic disorders,
and there is a superstitious belief
that serpents are blinded by looking at
the latter stone.</p>

<p class='c015'>Temperance advocates, if they have any
regard for the beliefs of the Greeks and
Romans, might seriously consider the advisability
of distributing amethysts among
drunkards, for it was supposed that these
stones prevented intoxication.</p>

<p class='c015'>Most of our readers have no doubt
heard of the precious jewel which the
toad carries in his brain-box, and so-called
toad-stones, which were in reality the
teeth of fossil fish, were formerly worn in
finger-rings as a protection against poisons.</p>

<p class='c015'>Although popularly supposed to be itself
a deadly poison, the diamond has
from remote ages been credited with the
power of protecting the wearer from the
evil effects of other poisons, a reputation
which it retained until comparatively recent
times.</p>

<p class='c015'>The superstitious use of jewels is not so
intolerable to think of, and certainly
would be less offensive to practise, but it
is evident that the patient’s recovery during
this period was owing to good luck
rather than to good management.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A KISS.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>A German Lover’s Definition of the Contact of Lips Puts Modern Lexicographers to Shame—How Monks Viewed It.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The dictionary informs the breathless
seeker after truth that a kiss is
“a form of salutation expressed
by the contact, with pressure, of the lips”—which
definition, though clear and concise,
seems to leave something to be desired.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jonathan Swift testily remarks:
“Lord! I wonder what fool it was that
first invented kissing”—and many more
are the disgruntled speeches which have
been made by men and women ever
since the art first became known on earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is probable that every mother’s son
of us—and daughter, too—has some sort
of idea of what a kiss is, in spite of the
reticence of the language Solons, but it
is doubtful if any one ever clothed the
idea more appropriately than the lover
who in 1679 wrote the epistle from which
the following extract is taken. It is
translated from the German.</p>

<p class='c014'>What is a kiss? A kiss is, as it were, a
seal expressing our sincere attachment:
the pledge of our future union; a dumb,
but at the same time audible, language of
a living heart; a present, which at the
same time it is given is taken from us;
the impression of an ardent attachment
on an ivory coral press; the striking of
two flints against one another; a crimson
balsam for a love-wounded heart; a sweet
bite of the lip; an affectionate pinching of
the mouth; a delicious dish which is eaten
with scarlet spoons; a sweetmeat which
does not satisfy hunger; a fruit which is
planted and gathered at the same time;
the quickest exchange of questions and
answers of two lovers; the fourth degree
of love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The monks of the Middle Ages divided
the kiss into fifteen distinct and separate
orders—the decorous, or modest kiss; the
diplomatic, or kiss of policy; the spying
kiss, to ascertain if a woman has drunk
wine; the slave kiss; the kiss infamous—a
church penance; the slipper kiss,
practised toward tyrants; the judicial
kiss; the feudal kiss; the religious kiss
(kissing the cross); the academical kiss
(or joining a solemn brotherhood), the
hand kiss; the Judas kiss; the medical
kiss—for the purpose of healing some
sickness; the kiss of etiquette; the kiss of
love—the only real kiss.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>LONG REACH FOR A GAVEL.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>Speaker of the House of Representatives
Served Lengthy Apprenticeship Before
He Was Called to Preside.</p>

<p class='c013'>Joseph G. Cannon, Speaker of the
House of Representatives, recently
concluded a few words of advice to a
writer investigating the condition of
affairs in the national government by saying:
“I don’t know but that I’d have you
study twenty years before beginning to
write.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The advice was not given sarcastically.
Cannon himself has gone about his work
thoroughly, systematically, and, to all appearances,
slowly. There has been nothing
spectacular or hysterical about his
progress, but the amount of ground covered
has been enormous. Every new
work undertaken has been based upon arduous
and exhaustive preparation in other
work leading to it. As a result he has
come from a clerkship in a country store
to the Speakership of Congress, and he
has filled the office ably in a stirring and
momentous period.</p>

<p class='c013'>Joseph G. Cannon is descended from
Massachusetts Quakers who migrated
from the colony to North Carolina to escape
persecution. His father was left a
penniless orphan in infancy, and two
maiden Quaker women adopted him and
supported him until he was able to study
medicine. The future statesman was
born in Guilford, North Carolina, in 1836,
and as the Quakers had protested persistently
against slavery, the South became
unsafe for them, and many, Dr. Cannon’s
family included, moved North. The Cannons
settled near the Wabash River, at
Annapolis, Indiana.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Cannon was drowned when Joseph
was fifteen years old. The doctor’s eldest
boy was in college, and the family decided
to allow him to finish his studies.
The youngest was near-sighted, and was
unable at that time to find employment.
Joseph, the second son, had shown self-reliance,
and had worked between school
hours, so he was sent to work in the
local general store. The first year’s pay
amounted to one hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the age of twenty Joseph had earned
a thousand dollars and saved five
hundred, and though his employers
tried to persuade him to stay, and
even offered him a partnership, he left
them to begin the study of law. The trial
of a slander suit he attended aroused in
him a resistless ambition to become a lawyer.
The privations he must undergo to
realize his ambition were patiently endured.
He took his five hundred dollars
and went to Terre Haute, where he entered
the office of John P. Usher.</p>

<p class='c013'>Office work for two years, supplemented
by six months’ study in a Cincinnati
law school, fitted him for practise. Before
he went to Cincinnati he had never
been in a large city, had never seen a theater,
and had heard but little music. The
city broadened him, for there he heard
Moncure D. Conway and Horace Mann,
and received a newer and truer idea of
the world. Practise in a large city was alluring,
and for a time he thought of settling
in Cincinnati. Then he turned from
it and located at Tuscola, Illinois.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first year he did not earn enough
to pay his board bill. He could not afford
to keep a horse to ride the circuit
as most of the other lawyers did, so he
tramped it over the prairies, picking up a
little business that gave him much work
and scarcely any money. Farm truck,
grocery orders, and on one occasion a
couple of cured hams, on another a side of
veal, on still another a pair of trousers
much too large for him, constituted some
of his fees. Shortly after he started practise
he had an appointment with a prospective
client. He waited until late in the
evening and the man did not come. Then,
in desperation, he started after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why didn’t you come to see me?”
asked Cannon when he had found him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh,” said the man easily, “I forgot to
tell you. I find I can pay more than I
expected, so I have hired another lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The struggle Cannon underwent was a
grim, hard one that called into play all
the sturdy qualities of his nature. Instead
of souring him as it has many other
men, it increased in him a desire to help
others who have the same fight to make,
and many a young man battling for a
practise, or facing the work of Congress
for the first time, has received the benefit
of it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Uncle Joe really knows how to help
a fellow,” said one of the young lawyers
to whom he had given a helping hand.
“He’s been up against it himself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The hardships of the first year of practise
gave way in the second year to
better things, and Cannon was able to
make a scant living and pay off his debts.
He went into politics, too, and stumped
the county, getting directly at the people,
winning fame among them as well as
winning the regard of his party managers.
He had a fairly good practise
when he decided to marry, and he built
a four-room cottage at Tuscola.</p>

<p class='c013'>His wife was an Ohio woman, and before
going to their new home the two
went to Chicago to buy furniture for it.
They selected Potter Palmer’s department
store as the best place, and were
highly pleased with the intelligence and
skill of the young clerk who waited on
them. His name was Marshall Field.
After spending part of the three hundred
dollars Cannon had with him, he proudly
brought his wife home to the little cottage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There, Mary,” he said as he walked
her from one room to another, “I don’t
think a young couple could ask for a
better start in life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His wife did all her own housework,
and as he was State’s Attorney for the
district until 1868, and earned about
fifteen hundred dollars a year, they considered
themselves prosperous. From
1868 to 1872 he built up a private practise,
and that paid him better. Besides,
the short-sighted brother had gone into
banking, had taken Joseph’s money for
investment, and succeeded mightily.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1872 “Old Joe” Gillespie pushed
Cannon forward for the Congressional
nomination, and Cannon not only won it,
but was elected after a brisk campaign.
He has been in Congress, with the exception
of one term, ever since then.</p>

<p class='c013'>Altogether, Mr. Cannon has served
thirty-two years, and, according to his
own statement, it has cost him three
hundred thousand dollars to live during
that time. The government has paid him
one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
The rest came out of his private income.
Nearly twenty years of the time has been
spent as a member of the Committee on
Appropriations. When the expenditures
steadily increased Cannon was taxed
with extravagance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You think,” he said in reply, “that
because I am chairman of the Committee
on Appropriations that it is my duty to
make appropriations. I tell you it is
rather my duty to prevent them being
made.”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the period of his service Congress
has spent nearly twelve billion
dollars. Since he has been Speaker it
has spent nearly two billion dollars, and
he has fought down expenses constantly.
It is a staggering total, but the country
that demanded such expenditures has
reached a wealth never attained by another
nation, and the leading men who
ran the government and made the appropriations
have been of giant size. Cannon
stands among the foremost.</p>

<p class='c013'>Speaker Cannon is a poor man, as far
as personal wealth is concerned, and yet
he is as happy as when he built the little
four-room cottage for his wife and with
her began the upward fight that has landed
him in a supreme position in the national
government.</p>

<h4 class='c010'>A DEVELOPER OF CITIES.</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Canadian Boundary Line Fails to Bisect the Sphere of Usefulness of a Massachusetts Man.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Henry M. Whitney has crowded
three or four great business careers
into his life, and each of them has
resulted in good to the community in
which he operated. His father, General
James S. Whitney, was fairly prosperous,
though there were then no capitalists and
no rich men, as rich men are reckoned
to-day, in Conway, Massachusetts, where
he lived.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henry M. Whitney was born in Conway
in 1839. He studied in the public schools
and at Williston Seminary until he was
sixteen years old; then he went to work
in the Conway Savings Bank. When his
father became collector of the port of
Boston, he went with him as a clerk, and
later, when the father entered the employ
of the Metropolitan Steamship Company,
the son again went with him, still as a
clerk.</p>

<p class='c013'>His rise was neither rapid nor spectacular,
but it was steady, continuous, and
solid. When General Whitney died in
1879 he was president of the Metropolitan,
and his son succeeded him in the office.</p>

<p class='c013'>At forty years of age Henry M. Whitney
was a fairly rich man, but known
to few people. The work that made his
name known throughout the country came
afterward. He had begun to deal in
suburban real estate in the vicinity of
Boston, and had picked Brookline as
especially fitted for development. It was
a section much favored as a place of
residence by Boston business men, and as
a first step in the development of his
holdings Whitney built, chiefly at his own
expense, a magnificent boulevard from
the town to Boston. Over this the men
who had offices in the city were accustomed
to drive daily, just as to-day they
go in their automobiles.</p>

<p class='c013'>The development and extension of the
trolley in the late eighties gave Whitney
another opportunity, and he built a trolley
line from Brookline to Boston. When
he reached the city limits he found himself
against a stone wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Boston horse-car companies would
not allow him to transfer his passengers
without their paying another fare, and
would make no provisions for connections
between the cars. They would not permit
him to get a franchise, and they ridiculed
the idea that their own lines would ever
be operated by electricity. The Brookline
line was sandbagged and rendered worthless,
for all it could offer passengers was
a pleasant, and, at the time, a novel ride
to the Boston city line.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whitney made several attempts to
persuade the Boston companies to allow
him to use their tracks, and offered to
stand part of the expense of installing
electric equipment. The offer was turned
down, and the little “West End” road
still hung on the ragged edge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Whitney went to work in another
way. He quietly bought up the stock of
the various companies, and when at last
matters came to a test he and his friends
were in control, and the “West End” entered
Boston. Later it gave its name to
practically the whole Boston street railroad
service.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a first result of Whitney’s control
and amalgamation of the Boston streetcar
lines, that city was among the earliest
in the country to benefit from an adequate
trolley service.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1893 Whitney got control of the
Cape Breton coal mines. Before then the
mines had dragged along, doing a fair
business, but not advancing to any extent.
The people in Cape Breton did not have
the money to develop them, and the English
capitalists in control were disinclined
to advance any money for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whitney saw a chance to push Cape
Breton coal into new markets, and soon
the mines at Louisbourg and Glace Bay
were doubling and trebling their output,
and Sydney and North Sydney became
thriving ports. He had also entered the
gas business in Boston, and he began importing
Cape Breton coal for the gas and
coke works at Everett, near Boston.
Such an increase in industry gave a tremendous
impetus to Cape Breton, but it
was not until Whitney added steel, coke,
and gas plants that Cape Breton realized
the full benefit of his work.</p>

<p class='c013'>About the time Whitney entered the
coal-mining industry, a fisherman had
come in with a killock so peculiar that
it drew attention. Examination showed
that it was almost pure iron ore. He had
found it near Belle Isle, between Newfoundland
and Labrador. Further search
showed that there were enormous deposits
of excellent iron ore at Belle Isle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sydneys had a good port and coal
in abundance. Whitney made the combination
that has resulted in the building of
the great iron works at North Sydney.
Fifteen years ago the two towns together
did not have much more than four thousand
inhabitants. At present they have
nearly five times that number, and are
thriving, growing cities, shipping enormous
quantities of coal, and the Dominion
Iron and Steel Company at North
Sydney is regularly turning out twenty
thousand tons of steel a month. About
three-fourths of this is steel rails, and
the enormous development of Canada’s
railroad extension easily calls for much
more than that.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cape Breton is no longer a negligible
section of the world, dependent on its
fisheries, the scanty farm produce that
its stony soil yields, and its mines slovenly
managed and ill-developed. It is
steadily growing rich, and the workers
are prosperous. Both of these conditions
are directly due to the foresight and
management of Henry M. Whitney.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>William L. Douglas, who stands
well in the forefront of the American
shoe manufacturers, alone makes
more shoes every year than were manufactured
in the entire country when he
started to learn the business.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Douglas was born in Plymouth,
Massachusetts, in 1845, and when he was
five years old his father died. At seven
he was apprenticed to a shoemaker, and
was put to pegging shoes. Practically
every operation was done by hand, though
Howe’s sewing-machine was used by the
more progressive manufacturers for
stitching the uppers. But the rest of the
work, fastening the soles included, was
done by hand, and the larger factories
employed only a dozen or so men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Douglas worked at the bench from six
o’clock in the morning until evening made
it too dark to see where to drive his
awl. At fifteen he could make a shoe,
from cutting the uppers and trimmings
and preparing the bottom stocks and
heels to sandpapering the soles and blackening
and burnishing the edges and heels.
Then he began to look around for easier
and more remunerative work.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cotton mills of the State seemed to
offer it, and he started in, as bobbin-boy,
to learn a new trade. He remained at it
only a few years, for he heard the glowing
stories of how much skilled shoemakers
were needed in the West. When he was
nineteen he went to Colorado, and after
working through a number of mining-camps
he located at Denver and opened
a cobbling shop.</p>

<p class='c013'>The prices he received for his work
were big, but they were nearly offset by
the prices he had to pay to live, and he
was forced to work sometimes sixteen
hours a day. He was of slight build, and
the strain began to tell on him to such
an extent that he was forced to abandon
the business and return East.</p>

<p class='c013'>By 1876 machinery had begun to revolutionize
the shoe business, and Massachusetts
was making shoes for the whole
country. Douglas had a few hundred
dollars, the savings of the long days in
Colorado, and he began manufacturing.
He could not afford to buy all the machines
necessary.</p>

<p class='c013'>He commenced with three men, working
himself. The little shop prospered
and grew. Before long it was sending
out shoes all over the country. As machinery
was improved and a greater output
became possible, the shop increased
its business and began to export shoes.
From the original output of forty-eight
pairs of shoes a week it has grown to
fifteen thousand pairs a day, and the shoes
are sent all over the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>The making of shoes and the organization
of a great Industry has not absorbed
Mr. Douglas’s whole attention. As a
Democrat he has been a member of the
Massachusetts House and Senate, Mayor
of Brockton, and in 1903 he was elected
Governor of Massachusetts, though the
State is usually Republican. He worked
during his campaign the way he worked
in business, putting in the number of
hours a day necessary to complete the
task set, and he kept his political lieutenants
working the same way. By this
means he became the first Democratic
executive the State has had since 1893,
and he gave the people a business administration
they liked.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Governor Douglas who settled
the disastrous Fall River strike, after a
number of futile attempts had been made
to bring about an understanding, and his
findings appealed to both sides, for the
workers knew he had once worked in
the mill and the employers recognized his
acute business sense.</p>

Though the fame of Henry Kingsley (1830–1876)
is eclipsed by that of his elder brother,
Charles, many critics have been bold enough
to predict that the time will come when the
English-speaking world will recognize the
younger of these brothers as the greater
writer. Henry Kingsley, leaving Oxford without
taking a degree, went to Australia when
he was twenty-three years old, and it was
not until his return to England, five years
later, that he addressed himself to novel-writing. His most popular
books were “Geoffrey Hamlin” and “Ravenshoe.” He wrote
few poems, and of these “The Blackbird’s Song,” which is here
reprinted for the readers of <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>, probably is the
best known. It has the real lilt of the English blackbird, and this,
together with its quaint diction, gives to it a peculiar quality
that causes it to linger in the mind long after the book containing
the poem has been laid aside.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>QUEER WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>For Many Centuries Native Tribes of Africa Have Had Systems of Communication Which Have Mystified White Travelers—Effective Use of Tom-Toms, Gourds, and Ivory Horns Keeps Villages in Touch With Each Other.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>There is nothing new under the sun,
not even the wireless telegraph.
To be sure, the system which has been in
use for centuries among the savage tribes
in the heart of Africa bears no resemblance
to our latest wonder, but it is
practical and effective, and its value has
been proved many times.</p>

<p class='c013'>A French explorer seems to have been
the first to describe it.</p>

<p class='c014'>By means of this system news of important
events in the interior of the Sudan
reaches all the trading ports on the
coast in a very short time, although there
is no electric telegraph or telephone in
the interior.</p>

<p class='c015'>The communication is made by means
of various instruments, the most commonly
employed being horns, tom-toms,
and whistles. The horns are of solid
ivory, made by hollowing out elephant’s
tusks. The mouthpiece is at the side.
These trumpets are of all sizes, but the
favorite ones are very long and give seven
distinct notes, produced by plugging the
mouth with corks of various sizes. The
ordinary tom-tom is a hollow log of wood,
with a goatskin stretched over one end.</p>

<p class='c015'>The following instance will illustrate
the way in which this native telegraph is
employed. The post commander at Stanley
Falls was informed by a native of a
neighboring village that a provision train
had been attacked by robbers two days
before at a point one hundred and eighty
miles farther down the Congo. A week
later the party arrived and confirmed the
story in part.</p>

<p class='c015'>They had reached the scene of the alleged
attack at the time reported, but the
shots which the natives had taken as indications
of a conflict with robbers had
been fired at a herd of antelopes.</p>

<p class='c015'>More recently, when an officer of the
French Congo came to grief in the rapids,
the accident was reported the next morning
at a village one hundred and eighty-six
miles distant.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the Bengala tribe a sort of xylophone
is used with four notes, by means
of which the natives hold communication
over great distances In a kind of telegraphic
language.</p>

<p class='c015'>The Rev. C. A. Rideout, an African missionary,
gives in the Kansas City <cite>Star</cite>
an account of this method of communication
over long distances of sparsely settled
country. He was working among the
Basutos when he discovered that the villages
had means of conveying messages
from one chief to another, or transmitting
the intelligence of defeat or victory.
Says Mr. Rideout:</p>

<p class='c015'>“A large gourd is hollowed out and
thoroughly dried. Then kid’s skin, as hard
and thin as parchment, is stretched across
the hollow of the gourd. When beaten
with a padded drumstick this gives forth
a sound which can be distinctly heard at
a distance of from five to eight miles.</p>

<p class='c015'>“In every village there is a class of men
who are utilized as scouts. Among these
guards there are always two or three
trained to the use of the gourd drum. The
code is practically an African Morse alphabet,
and is beaten on the drum in the
open air.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The sound is carried across the valleys
and glens to the next village, where
it is interpreted by another guard. If
the message is for a distant part, he repeats
it on his drum; and so it is carried
from village to village, with very little
loss of time, until it reaches the person for
whom it is intended.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I was granted the privilege of using
the gourd telegraph system to send messages
to our mission workers, and often
availed myself of it. I don’t know a single
instance where it failed to deliver its word
properly.</p>

<p class='c015'>“During the Boer War we, who were
hundreds of miles from the scene of hostilities,
got all the news with surprising
rapidity, and I have known of several instances
where tidings came by the gourd
air-line hours ahead of the message by
field-telegraph.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Who first invented the system nobody
knows. It has been in use for centuries.
There appears to be no difficulty in sending
any kind of a message, and I have
known one to travel nearly one thousand
miles.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By</span> MARY CAROLINE CRAWFORD.</div>
    <div class='c011'>Lieutenant James Holman Felt His Way ‘Round the World, Scaled Vesuvius, Hunted Wild Animals, Was a Russian Prisoner, a Guest of Princes, and Wrote His Own Experiences Though Sightless.</div>
    <div class='c011'><i>An original article written for</i> <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>We of the twentieth century
are rather too prone to believe
that such remarkable
cases of superiority to
circumstance as are supplied
by the lives of Helen Keller and
Thomas Stringer are peculiar to our own
time and country. Such, however, is not
the case. Certainly no more impressive
instance of accomplishment under trying
circumstances can anywhere be found
than in the travels and the accounts
thereof credited to Lieutenant James
Holman, who died in London almost
fifty years ago, after a full and happy
life. Not even the celebrated Baron von
Humboldt traveled so far or visited so
many countries as did Holman; and von
Humboldt had his sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Holman offers an extraordinary example
of what energy and perseverance
may accomplish. Driven out of the naval
service of his country by the complete
extinction of his sight when twenty-five
years of age, he found himself with his
youthful passion for travel still unsatisfied,
and with what might very probably
be a long and dreary life before him. A
naval officer who had already seen service
in England and America, he now
found himself forced to rearrange his
life plans entirely. Almost immediately
he resorted to Edinburgh University for
a term of study, but even the pleasures of
a cultivated mind could not reconcile
him to a life of inaction. Finding the
post of Knight of Windsor, which had
been conferred upon him, intolerable, he
obtained leave of absence, and prepared
to set out on his first journey of exploration.</p>

<p class='c013'>For more than forty years the blind
lieutenant kept continually on the march.
He traveled alone, for a valet, in his
opinion, was a useless incumbrance. Beginning
his travels with a tour of France,
Italy, Saxony, Switzerland, and Holland,
he next penetrated twenty-five hundred
miles beyond the Ural Mountains in Siberia.
After returning to Europe, he
circumnavigated the globe, visited the
west coast of Africa, the gold mines in
the Brazils, the colony of the Cape of
Good Hope, and the islands between that
country and China. In 1840 he again
left England—this time to explore the
Holy Land, and, incidentally, every
country touching the waters of the Mediterranean
and adjacent seas.</p>

<p class='c013'>Between these journeys it was Holman’s
custom to expand into books the
journal notes he had made <i>en route</i>.
The resulting volumes (formally dedicated,
by permission, “To the King’s
Most Excellent Majesty”) are packed
with shrewd comments upon men and
manners, and with delightful descriptions
of travel. Through these books
(now extremely rare) we are enabled
to-day to enter into the experiences of
one of the most interesting personalities
of which the last century can boast.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If my undertakings—for such they
may without vanity be called—be productive
of no other benefit,” he says,
“than that of proving to the world how
much may be done by a cheerful perseverance
under a heavy affliction—how
great obstacles may be subdued by resolution—how
the void of sight may be
peopled by an active mind, and the desert
fertilized by industry—how much
hope exists even in the darkest page of
life—and how many resources against
discontent and loneliness this beautiful
and varied world presents—I shall be
content to think my labors have not been
altogether destitute of utility.” This
rather labored though earnest sentence
does not, however, represent Holman at
his best. His earlier books are full of
spontaneity. While still a young man he
derived as much pleasure from writing
of his journeys as from making them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The manner in which the blind man
lets us share his sensations makes his
work peculiarly interesting. After we
have been wondering for a while how he
gets any fun out of the long, hard journeys
in the dark, he suddenly answers
the question thus: “I must candidly admit
that I have derived little gratification
from the external objects that presented
themselves, and am indebted to
the resources of my own mind for the
interest I felt; and in particular the
contemplation of future plans, as well
as the satisfactory progress I have already
made with regard to my present
ones which others have so often deemed
impracticable.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The truth is that Holman experienced
a boy’s delight in proving to his friends
that he could travel in safety and have
a good time into the bargain. “I find
less difficulty and inconvenience in
traveling among strangers than people
imagine, and prefer being left to my
own resources,” he says. “Habit has
given me the power of acquiring, by a
kind of undefinable tact, as correct ideas
of objects as the most accurate description
would give.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course, humorous situations were
of frequent occurrence. Once at Bordeaux
he heard water splashing at the
side of the coach. This went on for
something like an hour before he discovered
that the other passengers, the
better to insure their safety, had left the
vehicle and crossed on a ferry-boat, leaving
him to float with the carriage on a
raft across the river Dordogne.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I found that, while I supposed myself
sitting in the coach office yard at
Bordeaux,” he narrates, “I had actually
traveled four miles by water without
having entertained the least idea of such
an adventure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In this same book Holman describes
his custom of traveling with leading-strings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Finding myself suffering from headache,
which I attributed to want of exercise,”
he writes, “I made signs for the
driver to stop that I might get out of the
coach and walk for a time; he was quite
indisposed to accommodate me until I
manifested my intention of jumping out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He now thought well to stop his
horses and proffer his assistance; however,
I refused it, and succeeded in finding
the back part of the coach, where I
secured my hold by means of a piece of
cord (which when traveling I make a
rule to carry always in my pocket), and
which in the present instance served me
as a leading-string.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I then followed in this way on foot
for several miles, to the no small amusement
of the villagers, who laughed heartily
and even shouted after me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon reaching Rome, Holman went
to the Vatican. He had hoped to be allowed
to examine the sculpture carefully
with his hands, but this he was not
permitted to do, as soldiers were placed
in each apartment to prevent such violation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Had I been freely permitted to touch
the marbles, I doubt not,” he says,
“that I might have been as highly gratified
as those who saw, for the sense of
touch conveys to my mind as clear, or at
least as satisfactory, ideas of the form,
and, I think I may add, the force of expression,
as sight does to others. I did
occasionally examine them in this way by
stealth,” he adds, “when I was apprised
that the soldiers’ backs were turned toward
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Holman was doubtless the only blind
man who ever ascended Mount Vesuvius
and survived to record his impressions of
the feat. “My friends endeavored to
dissuade me from this arduous undertaking,”
he writes. “and when after fully
deciding upon the measure, I inquired
in what way it was customary for others
to make the ascent, they replied: ‘Oh,
they could <i>see</i> their way up.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Well, then,’ I retorted, ‘I have
little doubt of being able to <i>feel</i> mine.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>The ground proved to be too hot
under his feet, and the sulfurous vapors
too strong to allow the hardy Englishman
to remain long on the summit, but
his guide satisfied him by directing his
walking-cane toward the flames, which
shriveled the ferrule and charred the
lower part. He retained the cane as a
memorial, and mentions the fact in his
writings.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most dangerous journeys ever undertaken
by Holman were those into
the heart of Siberia, upon which he set
out soon after his return from his
initial visit to Florence. He occupied
himself on the way inland studying the
geography of Russia, tracing his intended
itinerary with his finger upon a raised
map.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the Academy of Art, in Saint Petersburg,
he was more successful than he
had been at the Vatican in his endeavor
to derive pleasure from the sculpture.
Of his experience with the Canova statue
of Napoleon he writes:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The pedestal of this statue is so high
that I could only reach the knees of the
figure; but this was sufficient to satisfy
me of its exquisite character. The
kneepan, the heads of the bones of the
leg, the muscles that form the calf, the
ankles, the contractions of the toes
(from the supposed weight of the body
resting upon them) were all inimitable,
so beautifully had the chisel written its
delineations on the marble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My gratification on touching it was
such that I could with difficulty withdraw
my hand; and had the leg been
clothed with a real shoe and stocking,
and of a natural temperature, I might
have imagined it real.”</p>

<p class='c013'>In Moscow this undaunted sightseer
walked to the Kremlin and “looked at”
the wonderful bell there by mounting
to its top on a ladder. The better to
examine some of the mortars cast in 1694
by Peter the Great, he coolly took off his
coat and crept to the bottom of one,
greatly to the astonishment of the guide
who accompanied him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Holman’s own explanation of the way
in which sightseeing of this sort ministered
to his pleasure is of decided interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The various organs of sense,” he
says, “are the mere instruments by which
the impressions of external objects are
conveyed to the mind, which then reasons
upon and draws its inferences respecting
the nature of these objects.
The conclusions thus arrived at are, consequently,
mere ideas.... It matters
not through what senses the impression
from which these ideas are derived are
transmitted. The reader will probably
now comprehend the manner in which
I arrived at what perhaps may be termed
an ideal knowledge of the places I visit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Accompanied by an intelligent
friend or guide, I examine every place
of interest—touch what I can and hear
of all, and then, combining the information
thus gained with previously acquired
knowledge of the subject and
some portion of imagination, a picture
is produced comprising in my mind a
strong impression of reality, and answering
the purpose, to me, almost as well as
if I had actually seen it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>To follow Holman as he calmly discusses
his own feelings concerning the
blindness which had come upon him is
of decided psychological interest. Suspense
was particularly difficult for him
to bear.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Any irritation of this nature renders
me the most anxious of mortals,” he
writes; “but let the excitement cease, no
matter whether in an agreeable manner
or the reverse, and my mind at once regains
its tranquility so that I become
comparatively comfortable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I then look back and smile at the
previous storm, and wonder that it has
exerted so powerful an influence over me.
For instance, with respect to the one
great affliction it has been my fate to
suffer—the loss of sight—my mind was,
during the period of suspense in which
I was long detained as to the final result,
in a state of excessive agitation and
distress; but no sooner was it ascertained
that the visual fire was quenched forever
than it at once rose superior to misfortune
and began to seek for and to find
occupation and consolation in a variety
of pursuits, among which the love of
traveling, as the reader will perceive, has
not been the least prominent.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The humors attending his odd position
were by no means lost upon him.
“Recollecting that I am suffering from
some deprivation,” he observes with gentle
irony, “people often mistake the
sense and begin to shout at me as if I
were deaf; in short, this feeling is so
general that almost every one who is not
intimately acquainted with me elevates
his voice in conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I am desired to give my hand
to examine anything by the touch, they
take it as if my sense of feeling were deficient,
squeezing it rudely, and pressing
it forcibly on the object of examination,
as if I were about to ascertain the condition
of a bird or beast; whereas my
sense of touch is most delicate, and all
that I require is to pass the hand lightly
over the surface of the body, and then
the result is both pleasing and satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Occasionally, of course, this eager
traveler made ludicrous mistakes. Once,
when he was being entertained in Siberia
by a family of distinction, he inquired
from his friend what extraordinary animal
it was that was making the singular
snoring sound on the other side of him,
which had for some time attracted his
attention. The “animal” proved to be
one of the principal counselors of the
town who had a peculiar obstruction in
his nasal organs which made him breathe
with a wheezing noise.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Siberian journey was the one in
which Holman especially delighted. He
had entered upon the arduous undertaking
“with feelings heightened by the
recollections of interest formerly derived
during eight years’ service on the coast of
North America.” Oddly enough, he expected
to find a great similarity in the
climate and productions of the two countries.
He was especially interested,
moreover, in the primitive simplicity and
manners of the Russian and Tatar tribes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of the Russians, certainly, he learned
a great deal during this journey. His
estimation of their character appears to
be singularly shrewd, and, for a blind
man, wonderfully penetrating.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Their natural quickness of mind and
sensibility of feeling,” he says, “gives
them the appearance of being a cheerful,
amiable, and open-hearted people; but
alas! under this exterior are concealed so
much disingenuousness and artful policy
as to diminish materially, on closer acquaintance,
that estimation to which they
would otherwise be justly entitled.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Seventy-five years before Kipling’s
“Truce of the Bear” was penned, another
Englishman had perceived the
close resemblance between the ursine
and the human—in Russia.</p>

<p class='c013'>The way in which the traveler overcame
the material difficulties of journeying
alone in a strange land is full of
interest. He tells us that he kept his
money in various bags, each of which
contained a definite number of coins of
different values. He was also provided
with tea and sugar, a teapot, cups, and
all that was necessary for the afternoon
refreshment so dear to the English heart.
Yet he did not spare himself when he
wished to cover a stipulated distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The man’s force of character was
never put to a severer test than when he
was made a Russian state prisoner on
suspicion of having assumed the pose of
“Blind Traveler” in order that he
might spy more effectively upon Russian
politics.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Czar had sent an aide-de-camp to
arrest him and put him over the frontier
without loss of time. During the ensuing
sledge journey, which continued
day and night for four thousand miles,
and of which he was himself compelled
to bear the expense, Holman became utterly
worn out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then he took matters into his own
hands; he decided that he needed a day’s
rest, and told his courier-guards that he
intended to take it. The Czar’s representatives,
including the Governor of
Moscow, ordered otherwise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Holman defied them all—if he felt
better next day, he would go with them;
but not before. A long and angry altercation
followed, but in the end he, a
sightless stranger among bigoted enemies,
won by sheer force of moral
strength. They finally left him a free
man on the border of the little republic
of Cracow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of Holman’s seven books, the later
volumes are considerably less intimate
and vivid than those written in the first
flush of his triumph over circumstances.
Nevertheless his adventures and research
among the gold mines of South Africa,
his description of an entertainment given
for him by a rajah of the East, his emotions
as he climbed a mast for the sake
of exercise, and the thrill which came to
him while hunting elephants make reading
of more than ordinary interest. The
sailor’s keen delight in a voyage, and the
Englishman’s unfailing weakness for
riding, never deserted this extraordinary
man. One of the best pen-pictures we
have of him, indeed, is astride a horse.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At the English consul’s,” writes
Francis Parkman from Girgenti, Sicily,
under the date, January, 1844, “I met a
blind traveler, a Mr. Holman, who has
been over Siberia, New Holland, and
other remote regions, for the most part
alone, and has written seven volumes of
his travels. Traveling, he told me, was
a passion with him. He could not sit at
home.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I walked home with him through the
streets, admiring his indomitable energy.
I saw him the next morning sitting on
his mule, with the guide he had hired.
His strong frame, his manly face, his
gray beard and mustache, and his sightless
eyeballs gave him quite a noble appearance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lieutenant Holman died in his London
chambers, July, 1857. He had
never married, so that the unpublished
journals and other literary material
which survived him was not placed before
the world as it probably would have
been had a devoted son survived him.
Through a relative who settled in Canada,
however, the name and the fame of
this remarkable man have come down
to us.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is due to the courtesy of a member
of Lieutenant Holman’s family, a young
artist, now in this country, that I am indebted
for the intimate details here given
concerning this intrepid traveler.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE LIGHT OF THE HARVEST MOON.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Its Brightness Enables Farmers to Gather in Their Crops During the Night—The Natural Phenomena Which Make September “The Month of Moonlight.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>September is “the month of
moonlight.” Poets and impressionists
at this season of the year,
have, from time immemorial, flooded the
world with harvest-moon imagery. Pictures
of moonlight lovers strolling along
moonlit lanes, rowing on moonlit rivers,
in moonlit boats, moonlight gleaners and
the harvest home have been painted over
and over again in word and color, but
the why and wherefor of the extraordinary
brilliance of the Queen of Night
during the period that she is known as
the “harvest moon” has been completely
lost sight of by the great majority.</p>

<p class='c013'>Those who observe the ordinary
astronomical phenomena of daily occurrence
are familiar with the time
variations in the moon’s rising and setting.
This is due to the direction of the
moon’s apparent path with reference to
the horizon, of whatever place it is
viewed from. Its distance from the
earth and its daily motion eastward in
right ascension.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the first few days in every lunar
month the moon rises or sets twenty-three
or twenty-four minutes later for
three or four successive evenings, after
which the retardation varies from that
time to an hour and seventeen minutes,
and sometimes more.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the latitude of New York the maximum
retardation is seventy-seven minutes
and the minimum is twenty-three.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the retardation is a minimum at
the time of the full moon, the light is
very powerful, and farmers have often
taken advantage of the practically all-night
brilliancy for several days, to harvest
their grain. September 21 being the
autumnal equinox and the full moon occurring
nearest that date being usually
in the height of harvest time, it is called
the harvest-moon.</p>

<p class='c015'>To understand the action of the causes
which produce this phenomenon it is necessary
to remember that at the time of
the autumnal equinox the sun sets exactly
in the west, and the southern half
of the ecliptic, or the sun’s apparent annual
path in the sky, will then be wholly
above the horizon and the northern half
entirely below; the ecliptic, therefore,
making the least possible angle with the
horizon.</p>

<p class='c015'>In high northern latitudes, as in
Alaska, British Columbia, Norway and
Sweden and the north of Scotland, the
moon’s path at such times is almost
parallel with the horizon, and for more
than a week she rises at very nearly the
same time, giving the farmers ample light
and time to garner their crops.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>A POEM IN WHICH A DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN POET AND DIPLOMAT EXPRESSED HIS FEAR OF OLD WORLD INFLUENCES.</div>

With the single exception of John Hay, no
English-speaking poet has been so distinguished
as a student of the social and political
phases of national life as was James
Russell Lowell (1819–1891). It is doubtful
whether the United States ever produced a
poet who was more truly national. His earlier
verses were characterized by quaint
Yankee humor, and many were virile pictures
of New England life. In his later years,
as a writer, editor, and lecturer, Lowell labored zealously to bring
the literature and culture of the New World to a plane as high as
that of the Old World. As a diplomat, he did more to cement the
friendship of Great Britain and the United States than any man
had done before. His official title, while in England, was that of
United States Minister to Great Britain, but a London newspaper
bestowed upon him another—“His Excellency the Ambassador of
American Literature to the Court of Shakespeare.”</p>

<p class='c015'>But though Lowell was cosmopolitan in many of his tastes, he
was essentially a patriotic American. The great influx of foreigners
and foreign ideals into the United States oftentimes excited
his apprehension, and it was while under the influence of these
fears that he wrote “The Sower,” which is printed herewith.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>ELEVENTH HOUR PERFORMANCES.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Some Wonderful Achievements Wrought Against Time by Celebrated Men of Genius Who Saved Critical Situations at the Last Minute—Phenomenal Records by Artists and Composers.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The world of genius abounds with
stories of marvelous achievements
at the last moment, especially the musical
and artistic branch of it. Strange though
it may seem, some of the finest music and
paintings have been executed in a rush
against time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There goes Leader, off to paint his
dally picture,” was the usual comment of
his neighbors, upon seeing the artist
leave his rooms early in the morning
with a canvas on his back. Although
this may, perhaps, have been a too flattering
anticipation, it is a well-known fact
that on several occasions the academician
produced a large picture within a few
hours.</p>

<p class='c015'>Marvelous as is Benjamin Williams
Leader’s rapidity with his brush, he has
a formidable rival in Solomon J. Solomon,
A.R.A., who painted an admirable life-size
portrait of Israel Zangwill for the Academy
Exhibition within five hours of taking
up his brush.</p>

<p class='c015'>But neither Leader nor Solomon would
dispute the honors of swift workmanship
with Sir Edwin Landseer. He had promised
a picture for the Spring Exhibition
of the British Institution in 1845, but on
the day before the exhibition was to be
opened all the hanging committee had received
was an empty frame, which was
duly hung in the position of honor.</p>

<p class='c015'>As the prospect of the frame receiving
a picture for the opening seemed very
slight, a member of the committee went
to interview the artist. He found Landseer
standing in front of a bare canvas.</p>

<p class='c015'>“That’s the picture I promised,” said
Sir Edwin, pointing to the canvas. “I
haven’t touched it yet, but I will send it
to the institution to-night.”</p>

<p class='c015'>A few hours later the completed picture
was delivered, and may be seen to-day in
the National Gallery. This wonderful work
of half a dozen hours was none other than
the universally admired “Cavalier’s Pets.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Sir Arthur Sullivan composed the brilliant
epilogue of the “Golden Legend” in
less than twenty-four hours. He sat down
at nine o’clock one evening to compose
the overture to “Iolanthe,” and did not rise
from his desk until the last note was
written at seven o’clock on the following
morning, while the overture to the
“Yeoman of the Guard” occupied him no
more than twelve hours, both to compose
and score.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is told of Gaetano Donizetti that he
wrote the instrumentation of an entire
opera within thirty hours. On the very
morning on which Gioacchino Antonio
Rossini’s “Gazza Ladra” was to be produced
not a single note of the overture
had been written, and the manager was
in despair. He sought out the lazy composer,
locked him in one of the rooms of
La Scala, and declared he should have
neither food nor freedom until the overture
was completed. Rossini set to work
with a will and to such purpose that the
music was written and rehearsed before
the evening performance.</p>

<p class='c015'>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was equally
as indolent and procrastinating as Rossini.
At twelve o’clock on the night before
the production of “Don Giovanni” the
composer was making merry with a party
of convivial friends and had forgotten that
the overture was unwritten. As he was
going to bed, in the early hours of the
morning, his wife reminded him of the
fact that it was the day of production and
that the overture was not touched. He
asked her to make him a bowl of punch
and help keep him awake, and sat down to
his work as the light of dawn began to
stream through the window. He fell
asleep, completely exhausted, and slept
soundly for a short time. At five o’clock
he resumed his work, and two hours later
the overture was finished.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is said that Herr Stehmann learned
the entire part of the <i>Wanderer</i> in “Siegfried”
in six hours; and on one occasion
when Herr Kraus, who was to have taken
the leading rôle in Xaver Scharwenka’s
“Mataswinka,” was suddenly taken ill,
Stehmann, who had never before seen the
part, mastered it so completely between
the afternoon rehearsal and the evening
performance, that in both words and music
he was absolutely perfect.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>LASSOOED THE COMPLIMENT.</h3>

<p class='c018'>Slow Speech of a Stranger Caused Miss
Morewin to Sacrifice Conventionality
on the Altar of Curiosity.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>There must be times when actors are
put in the embarrassing position of
hearing their work discussed in public
places by people who have seen the performance
and are not aware that any of
those who have taken part in it are within
ear-shot. And sometimes, when there is
a wag in the party, there are real dramatic
moments in such episodes. Here is
a case in point that happened in New
York not so very long ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>A party of men were descending in the
elevator on their way to lunch in one of
New York’s tallest skyscrapers. The car
stopped at a floor and a lady got on. The
wag in the group of men instantly recognized
her as Louise Morewin, who plays
the mother-in-law in “The Heir to the
Hoorah,” which he had seen a few nights
before.</p>

<p class='c013'>The car was pretty well crowded and
the wag was so placed that in the mirror
he could see Miss Morewin’s face without
being seen himself. And the spirit of mischief
entered his soul.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say, fellows,” he began, “you have all
seen ‘The Heir to the Hoorah.’ What do
you think of the mother-in-law?”</p>

<p class='c013'>One and another expressed an opinion,
more or less non-committal so far as the
playing of the part was concerned. But
this did not satisfy the wag. It must be
remembered that the building is very tall
and that it requires some minutes for the
elevator to reach the ground floor, so after
the other comments had been gathered in,
there was still time for a snapper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well,” he remarked, “I saw the play
the other night, and I think the actress
who plays that mother-in-law is——”</p>

<p class='c013'>He inserted a pause for impressiveness,
and Miss Morewin could stand no more.
Stepping around so that she faced him
she broke out with:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, what <i>do</i> you think of her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think she is immense,” finished the
wag, utterly unruffled, while his friends,
who had failed to recognize their fellow
passenger, stood with jaws dropped at the
spectacle of the strange woman butting
into their conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for Miss Morewin, she smiled, flushed
a little, and when the car reached the
street level, she hastily mingled with the
throng and was lost to sight.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THE MODEST CHORUS MAN.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Owners of Bass and Tenor Voices are Regarded As Necessary Evils by the Producers of Musical Comedies.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>We hear much of the chorus girl, but
very little of the chorus man, who
is no doubt considered by the manager a
necessary evil, inasmuch as girls are not
endowed, outside of dime museums at
least, with bass and tenor voices. I know
one of the four chorus men who made an
oasis of deep tones in the blossoming garden
of Weber &#38; Fields’s girls, but he soon
was promoted from the ranks to a principal
part and is now reaping profits as a
writer of comic songs.</p>

<p class='c013'>He went into the business because he
wanted to go on the stage, and found this
the easiest door to it. Why do other
chorus men take up the thing, I asked myself,
and to find out, I proceeded to get
acquainted with two young fellows in the
George M. Cohan company, where chorus
work is a very important feature of the
proceedings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why did you take up this line?” I
asked outright of one fellow, a big-boned
chap who was formerly a cigarmaker in
Chicago.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because I wanted to see the world,” he
replied. “That’s the reason I prefer one-night
stands to long runs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you must run up against some
hard ones in the way of dressing-rooms
among the small towns of the country,” I
reminded him. And then I told of some
“Florodora” girls I had heard about who
were each assigned a chair on which to
make their half-dozen or more changes of
costume.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, exclaimed the former cigar-man,
that’s nothing. I’ve had to dress on the
turn of a stairs, where the bend made an
extra wide step.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How easy is it for a man to get into
the chorus?” was my next query.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If he has a good second bass or high
tenor voice, it’s a cinch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I then discovered that physique counts
more than it used to, not good looks, for
make-up will cover freckles or sallow skin,
but a fellow must be well-built, and know
how to hold himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other chap, also from Chicago, used
to be in the electric business, but with his
brother he happened to belong to a lodge
of the Order of the Maccabees. They could
both sing and dance, and at an entertainment
of the lodge did so in public. This
put the stage bee in the head of the
younger, and through cheek and shameless
recitations of utterly fictitious engagements
he had already filled, he procured
a chance to do <i>Pish-Tush</i> in a
“Mikado” company that stranded after
two performances.</p>

<p class='c013'>Prevarication, in fact, seems to be the
order of the day in the theatrical business,
so that I cannot for the life of me make
out why one member of the profession
should ever believe what the other says,
knowing the rule of the road, as it were,
and what he would say himself under similar
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c013'>This Earl Stanley (the grandiloquent
stage name my second chorus friend chose
for himself) knew nothing about making-up
and learned it by deftly following the
motions of the man he was assigned to
dress with, who actually remarked on the
newcomer’s aptness in the art.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You two fellows,” I observed, “were
lucky to get an all-summer engagement
with ‘The Governor’s Son’ on the roof,
after ‘George Washington, Jr.,’ closed. All
the chorus men were not held over, by a
long shot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All the good ball players were,” replied
Lisle, and then it came out that
Cohan is a baseball fiend, and to play
good ball, all other things being equal,
assists a man in getting a job in his companies,
each of which sports its nine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh, as to a chorus man’s pay, it ranges
from eighteen to thirty dollars a week, all
costumes being furnished by the management.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>RECALCITRANT BENEFACTOR.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Sarah Bernhardt Encountered Series of Failures While Trying to Reward Man Who Befriended Her Family.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Last June Sarah Bernhardt sailed back
to Paris after the most successful
season she ever had in America. She took
her profits with her in gold, too, and nobody
should begrudge her the money, for,
besides being a great artist, she is a
generous soul, and is not chary of passing
her good fortune on to others.</p>

<p class='c013'>The following instance of this spirit of
generosity is recorded by the San Francisco
<i>Call</i>, and vouched for as authentic by
one of <span class='sc'>The Scrap Book</span> staff who has personal
knowledge of the affair:</p>

<p class='c014'>When Sarah Bernhardt was in the city
some years ago she gave a breakfast to
some of her friends at the California
Hotel. It was served about noon, and
there were but three persons present besides
herself.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the midst of the repast a bell-boy
knocked at the door and said that there
was a man down-stairs who refused to
give his card and insisted on coming up to
see her.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Let him come, then,” was her reply.</p>

<p class='c015'>The bell-boy explained that he had the
appearance of a tough-looking tramp and
might be crazy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Never mind his looks or his clothes,
he may be a friend of mine,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c015'>In a few minutes a man of about sixty
or more entered the room. He was very
shabbily dressed, had not shaved for a
week, and his shirt-front was well garnished
with tobacco-juice.</p>

<p class='c015'>The instant Bernhardt saw him she gave
an exclamation and bounded forward.
She threw herself upon his neck and covered
his rough face with kisses.</p>

<p class='c015'>The man was Mr. Levi, a furrier, who
died recently in this city. Many of the
<i>Call</i> readers will remember his short,
heavy figure as he used to walk the streets
with furs thrown over his shoulder, looking
for customers.</p>

<p class='c015'>Bernhardt at once made a place at the
table and began opening champagne for
her guest. She introduced him as an old
friend from Paris and explained that when
she was a child and her family was in
straits Mr. Levi had cared for them all
one winter and kept them from absolute
want.</p>

<p class='c015'>Every few moments she would jump up,
clasp him about the neck and kiss him
again and again. There was no acting
about these embraces, she was glad to see
him, and she wanted no misunderstanding
on that score.</p>

<p class='c015'>Presently she asked him why he did
not go back to Paris and see his relatives.
He answered, sadly, that he was not able.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, that is easily remedied,” she said,
and a moment later she had written out
a check for fifteen hundred dollars and
thrown it across the table to him.</p>

<p class='c015'>He picked it up, and when he saw the
amount he broke down completely. With
the tears streaming down his cheeks he
said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Sarah, I didn’t come here for charity,
but just to see you a few moments.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He handed the check back across the
table.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Oh, not enough? I make it bigger.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She wrote another check for two thousand
dollars and threw it over to him. He
looked at the second check and merely
said:</p>

<p class='c015'>“Give me the other, Sarah.”</p>

<p class='c015'>She smiled as she handed it to him, and
then the old man did a magnificently independent
thing. He slowly placed the
two checks together, tore them into bits
and handed the fragments back to the
madame.</p>

<p class='c015'>“No, no, Sarah; no money. Just your
gratitude; that is all I ever wanted.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Then she was at his side again, kissing
his tears away and sobbing herself. It
was a very pathetic scene and one not
easily forgotten by those who witnessed it.</p>

<p class='c015'>She said that she would “fix him
yet” in that peculiar way of hers, which
always means that she intends to have
her own will.</p>

<p class='c015'>Some months later I was in San Francisco
and met old Levi waddling along
the streets with his furs. He stopped me
and said he wanted my advice.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I have just got a letter from Sarah,”
he said, “and I don’t know what the devil
to do about it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>He translated the letter as he read it,
and it went something like this, as near
as I can recall it:</p>

<p class='c015'>“You tore up the last check I gave you,
which was very mean of you. I was very
angry at the way you treated my checks.
No one else ever did such a thing to me but
you, and you make me angry every time I
think of you and your treatment of me.
You humiliate me before strangers. They
must have thought that my checks were
worthless, or you must have thought so.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I now enclose another and larger one.
It is for twenty-five hundred dollars of
your American money and if that is not big
enough send it back and I will make it
larger, but some check of some denomination
you must accept, and if I gave you
all the money I ever earned it would not
repay you for the time years ago in Paris
you saved me from want. I shall expect
you to come to Paris at once and be my
guest. Answer yes by cable and make us
all happy. If you do not do this you must
never call on me again, as I shall refuse
to receive you. Affectionately,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c026'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Sarah</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“What shall I do?” asked the old man
with tears in his eyes. “She is bound to
have her way. She always was that way
as a child.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Better send the despatch and then cash
the check and go to Paris.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I guess I’ll have to,” said the old man,
and he started for the telegraph office.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>BETTER THEATER PROGRAMS</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Innovation at Weber’s May Result in the Disappearance of Smudgy Blanket Sheets in Other Playhouses.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>When the late Clement Scott, the
well-known English dramatic critic,
visited this country in 1900, he wrote
his impressions of American theaters for
the London <cite>Sketch</cite> and devoted his second
paragraph to the bill of the play. His
comment ran as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>No fees for programs? I should think
not, indeed! You find a huge stack of them
under your very nose, and you can take
any number you like, from one to one hundred.
The difficulty Is to find the actual
program when you have possessed yourself
of one of these bulky pamphlets, for
there is only a “halfpennyworth of program”
amid “an intolerable deal of
sack” in the way of advertisements and
facetiæ.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mr. Scott failed to mention the
worst feature of the American programs—the
black smut left on the ladies’ gloves
and the men’s knuckles from the smudgy
type with which they are printed. The
sixpence one must part with in order to
become possessed of a London house-bill
is really not begrudged in exchange for the
neat card, folded at the two sides to make
it convenient for the pocket and on which
the most prominent features are the details
respecting the play you have come to
see.</p>

<p class='c013'>In New York the program concession
has been for years in the hands of a big
firm which has paid the theaters large
sums for the privilege of distributing bills
of the play, and audiences have had to submit
in patience to what this monopoly was
pleased to give them. But there is hope
ahead and Joe Weber deserves the credit
for being the pioneer in a worthy innovation
to make theatergoing the all round
pleasure it ought to be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just before he closed the doors of his
music hall for the summer, Mr. Weber
amazed his patrons by providing them
with a <i>program de luxe</i>, each enclosed in
an oiled paper envelope, and printed in
four colors on heavy coated paper. To be
sure, it consists of forty-two pages, including
the cover, but the bill of the play is in
the exact center, making it easy to find,
and the advertisements are most attractively
displayed and illustrated.</p>

<p class='c013'>The thing was got up by a firm of four
hustling young men, who have already
thrown into a panic the older firm, causing
them to announce for this new season
lithographed covers done in six colors.
Whether as a whole the thing will be as
attractive as the Weber program remains
to be seen, but, in any case, the public
are to be congratulated, for as the spirit
of competition has entered the field, audiences
will reap the benefit.</p>

<p class='c013'>In London you buy your program from
the young woman who shows you to your
seat, for whom this practical Clement
Scott had no great liking. Of this young
woman Mr. Scott said:</p>

<p class='c014'>I prefer the American “usher,” with the
suave but determined manner, to our
haughty and flighty girls at home, who
think it a condescension to show you to
your seat, the whereabouts of which they
are usually as ignorant of as you are
yourself. In an American theater you are
marshaled to your seat with military regularity.
In England you are at the mercy
of some Miss Tousle Head who, so far
as her business is concerned, is either insolently
independent or sublimely ignorant.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>CRITICS BAD WEATHERCOCKS.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>Last Season’s Records Proved Inability of Newspaper Writers to Show How Dramatic Winds Were Blowing.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Of what use are dramatic critics anyway?
Brady’s attack on them from
the stage last winter was a mere pin-prick
to the humiliation they must feel as
makers of public opinion in connection
with “The Lion and the Mouse.” When
the play was brought out in New York last
fall the comments were almost universally
adverse, yet the people took to the piece
like ducks to water, and it looks now as if
it would run the year round at the Lyceum.
When it was tried in London, on
the other hand, the reviews were exceedingly
favorable, and yet the thing lasted
barely two weeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Take, for example, the London <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite>, which summed up its report in
these words: “To last night’s audience,
let it be added, the piece made evidently
a very direct and forcible appeal, the applause
at the end of the third act, as on
the final fall of the curtain, being of the
most tumultuous and enthusiastic description.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The <cite>Standard</cite> declared: “‘The Lion
and the Mouse’ is a play to be seen—it
is imperfect and crude, but it is drama,
strong, intense, undeniable.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The <cite>Tribune</cite> even went so far in its
praise that it felt constrained to add: “As
a sop to our national self-respect, however,
we may remember that the author, Charles
Klein, hails originally from this side of the
Atlantic.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>PLAYHOUSE NOMENCLATURE.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>The Names of Some Recently Christened Theaters Indicate a Painful Lack of Propriety and Variety.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The announcement that David Belasco
will manage the new theater to be
built in Forty-Fourth Street, and will call
it the Stuyvesant, adds another appropriately
named house to the group that has
been growing up in New York of late
years. The Hudson, the New Amsterdam,
the Knickerbocker, the Manhattan and the
Astor are all indigenous of the soil and
are to be commended.</p>

<p class='c013'>Liberty is not bad, although, to be sure,
it would be more happily situated in Philadelphia
than in Gotham. The Quaker City
is now to make a needed departure from
its run on street nomenclature by calling
the house now building the William Penn
Theater.</p>

<p class='c013'>Speaking of Pennsylvania, it was too bad
Pittsburgh sank the historic Duquesne in
“Belasco”—all right in itself, but the
name Belasco loses its force as a distinctive
title when duplicated too many times.
Three cities now have theaters of this
title—New York, Washington, and Pittsburgh.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Shuberts, more’s the pity, will soon
be as thick as huckleberries in August.
The house that should be known by this
name is the Princess in New York, which
would thereby be exchanging a cognomen
perfectly inappropriate in America, for one
that would much better stand over one
house in New York than over twenty elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a thousand pities that the name
Booth was suffered to vanish from over a
theater’s doors when Booth’s, at the corner
of Sixth Avenue and Twenty-Third
Street, was pulled down. All that remains
of it is a bust of Shakespeare in the side
wall of McCreery’s, on the latter thoroughfare.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is odd, too, when you come to think
of it, that we have no Shakespeare Theater.
It is a pity Charles Frohman did not
use this—or at any rate Globe (the name
of the house Shakespeare managed) rather
than Empire. This might better have been
Republic, which, when the Empire was
opened in 1893, was still in the market,
not having been affixed to the theater
which Hammerstein built later and very
soon passed over to Belasco. Another
absolutely footless theater name in the
United States is Savoy. Garrick is good,
and Criterion not bad.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>WHAT MAKES A PLAY?</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>English Managers Tell of the Methods They Employ In Estimating Value of Manuscripts.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>Not long since the <cite>Grand Magazine</cite>, of
London, held a symposium of opinions
from the leading English managers
on the elements in a play which determined
their acceptance or rejection of it.
It cannot be said that the result may be
read with much profit by the aspiring
playwright. Doubtless those managers
who, according to a footnote, declined
“for one reason or another” to discuss
the methods which governed their choice,
were wiser in their day and generation
than those who did. For, after all, it is
a gamble. And what’s one man’s meat
may be another’s poison.</p>

<p class='c013'>Take, for example, the assertion of
Frederick Harrison, of the London Haymarket.
He declares:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must be quite alone when I read a
play, secure from interruption, and read
it through at a sitting, and rapidly. If it
will not bear rapid reading there is generally
something wrong—incoherence of
story, clumsiness of dialogue, or something
that detracts from the probability
of success for the play.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Contrast this method with an incident
vouched for in the <cite>Dramatic Mirror</cite> by the
popular playwright Haddon Chambers, on
his recent visit to this country. Speaking
of one of his most successful plays,
he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Beerbohm Tree had the piece
three months before he ever looked at it.
Then, one day, I managed to read him the
first two acts. The following day he was
slightly indisposed and very courteously
put me off. I saw him go into the Turkish
bath, followed him, finished the reading
then and there, and had the work accepted.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lewis Waller, the actor-manager, practically
gets no further in the course of
half a page report than telling the kind of
play he does <i>not</i> want—ordinary melodrama
or a farcical comedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Frank Curzon, who rivals Charles Frohman
in the number of theaters he manages,
and who is now a partner with
James K. Hackett in “Mr. Hopkinson”
and other ventures in America, says, on
the other hand:</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I read a play, I do not care to
which class it belongs. If it hits me hard
enough I produce it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The recipe for George Edwardes, the
great musical comedy producer, is first
an idea that shall be simple in character
but capable of elaboration in a way that
shall give striking opportunities to the
members of his company. Often the
<i>locale</i> or the background for the piece
is selected long before the plot is attached
to it.</p>

<p class='c013'>W. H. Kendal, who frequently used to
visit us with his wife—a sister of the late
Tom Robertson, the teacup and saucer
playwright—insists rather indefinitely
that the characters shall live before him
and that their story shall interest him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Tom B. Davis, another musical comedy
expert, in whose theater “Florodora” was
brought out, thinks that the plot is not
of supreme importance, but he wants the
low comedian woven into the story in such
a way that when the lovers find themselves
in a predicament the audience shall
know that it is he who will help them out.
He also deems it advisable that “a dramatic
situation shall be led up to in the
finale of the first act, in which the baritone
and the prima donna shall be the
central figures.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Altogether, Mr. Davis is the most explicit
in his rules of any of the bunch,
for of the two remaining entries for the
<i>Grand’s</i> symposium, Fred Terry—who
originally produced “Sunday”—sums up
the order in which the interesting factors
in a play should be put as, first, Heart;
second, Heart; third, Heart, and Cyril
Maude, the English <i>Little Minister</i>, confines
himself to the statement that he
would not choose a gloomy play.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Some of the Follies of Which Men and Women of Genius Have Been Guilty—Queen Elizabeth Was Profane, Queen Victoria Was Superstitious, While Bacon, Dickens, and Longfellow Were Confirmed Dandies.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>No man or woman is so strong as to
be wholly free from weakness. If
a man occupies an humble sphere in life
he usually is fortunate enough to keep
his fads and follies from becoming
known beyond his own circle of friends.
If, on the other hand, he has attained
sufficient distinction in the world to be
called “famous,” he must reconcile himself
to seeing the public in possession of
all knowledge that has to do with his
personal peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c014'><b>Descartes</b> had a small garden where he
spent all the hours not devoted to mental
labor.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Queen Elizabeth</b> was very profane, and
when angry would kick and cuff her
maids.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Matthew Arnold’s</b> dogs, cat, and canary
bird are mentioned dozens of times in his
poems.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Domitian</b> spent his leisure in catching
flies and piercing them through with a
needle.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>William the Conqueror</b> was immoderately
devoted to dog-fighting and bear-baiting.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>David</b>, the artist, when not painting,
amused himself by scraping on an old
fiddle.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Mirabeau</b> loved dogs, and had a famous
pet, Chico, to which he was much attached.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Mrs. Radcliffe</b> ate raw pork before going
to work on a particularly thrilling chapter.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Pierex</b>, after work hours, busied himself
in arranging and caring for his coins and
medals.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Washington</b> was devoted to fox-hunting,
and in the season usually hunted twice a
week.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Socrates</b> was fond of playing with children,
and was often seen busy with them
at their games.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Mme. de Staël</b> always carried a bit of
a stick in her hand and played with it as
an aid to conversation.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Blackmore</b>, the novelist, was fond of
gardening, and spent in that amusement
all he made by writing.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Leigh Hunt</b>, when tired out with work,
found relaxation in riding to and fro on
the London omnibuses.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Dumas</b>, père, disliked a noise in the
house while he was writing, and kept a
pet buzzard in his room.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Vincent</b>, the landscape painter, disliked
violets, and always avoided a field or garden
where they grew.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Prince Rupert</b>, the cavalryman, was
fond of chemistry, and invented the glass
drops called by his name.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Berlioz</b>, though so famous as a composer,
could play no instrument except
the guitar, and that very badly.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Hazlitt</b> was an enormous drinker of
strong tea, which completely upset his
nerves and made him miserable.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Tycho Brahe</b>, “the Wizard of the Golden
Nose,” always became sick at the stomach
whenever he saw a fox.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Herrick</b>, the poet, was fond of pigs as
pets, and taught one to follow him about
and to drink beer out of a mug.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Francis Bacon</b> was very fond of fine
clothes, and spent much of his leisure
in devising new costumes for court occasions.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Edward Fitzgerald</b> was a vegetarian,
and believed that in adopting such a diet
he had, to quote his own words, found
“the great secret of it all.”</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Charles Dickens</b> was fond of wearing
gaudy jewelry, and the clanking of his
numerous gold chains announced his
coming while he was yet some distance
away.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Henry W. Longfellow</b> had a weakness
for flowered waistcoats, and he possessed
many of gorgeous pattern and color.</p>

<p class='c015'><b>Queen Victoria</b> of England shared the
common superstition about salt. She
would reprimand any guest who was unfortunate
enough to spill it, and throughout
the remainder of the meal she would
be disturbed and in ill-humor.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The House and the Brain.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div><span class='sc'>By</span> E. BULWER LYTTON.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='double'>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c023'>“The House and the Brain” has been called by many critics the most
powerful and appalling story of the supernatural ever written in the
English language. It appeared in 1859 in the pages of <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite>,
where it was read by thousands with a fascinated horror. Sir Edward
Hamley said of it: “So elusive is the atmosphere of the tale, so vivid the
description of its terrifying appearances, and so effective their connection
with the agency of a malignant being possessed of supernatural powers,”
that many were half convinced of its actuality. Soon after its appearance in
<cite>Blackwood’s</cite>, a gentleman wrote to the editor of that magazine: “For God’s
sake tell me what truth there is in this terrible story! My daughter has
known no rest or peace since reading it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Its author, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, was one who, like Scott, felt a
profound interest in the world of mystery. He believed in the occult powers
of nature and in the strange arts of those who sought to use them. He
himself “dived into wizard lore, equipped himself with magical implements,
and communed with mediums and spiritualists.” The literature of alchemy
and divination he studied with intense eagerness. On one occasion he drew
up what he called a “geomantic figure,” by means of which he foretold the
future of Disraeli. This was before that brilliant personage was seriously
regarded by his associates; yet Bulwer Lytton accurately predicted his
coming political triumphs and the fact that he would be at some day Prime
Minister of England. After his famous ghost-story had appeared in print,
Bulwer Lytton saw that he had given to a short story an idea too valuable
for so slight a treatment. Therefore, when the tale was subsequently reprinted,
he suppressed the second half of it and made the story end with the
discovery of the secret chamber in the haunted house. The latter part he
made the basis of his weird and almost equally powerful romance of mystery
“A Strange Story” which was published in 1862. This is constructed
around the central notion that there are arts which can indefinitely prolong
human life; and in his book the chief character is the human serpent, Margrave,
infinitely depraved, possessed of supernatural power and renewing
his youth by mystical arts so that he is ever young and capable of fresh evil
even at the end of centuries of his existence. The conception is no less bold
than fascinating, and it is worked out by its author in a terrifying way. Yet
nowhere does it attain to the pitch of horror and to the power of affecting
the human nerves which we find in the earlier short story of which the
original title was “The Haunters and the Haunted.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The story as printed here gives the complete text precisely as it was
first published in the pages of <cite>Blackwood’s.</cite></p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>A friend of mine, who is a
man of letters and a philosopher,
said to me one day,
as if between jest and earnest,
“Fancy! since we last
met I have discovered a
haunted house in the midst of London.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Really haunted? and by what—ghosts?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I can’t answer these questions;
all I know is this: six weeks ago I and
my wife were in search of a furnished
apartment. Passing a quiet street, we
saw on the window of one of the houses
a bill, ‘Apartments Furnished.’ The situation
suited us; we entered the house,
liked the rooms, engaged them by the
week, and left them the third day. No
power on earth could have reconciled my
wife to stay longer; and I don’t wonder
at it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What did you see?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me; I have no desire to be
ridiculed as a superstitious dreamer, nor,
on the other hand, could I ask you to
accept on my affirmation what you would
hold to be incredible, without the evidence
of your own senses. Let me only
say this: it was not so much what we
saw or heard (in which you might fairly
suppose that we were the dupes of our
own excited fancy, or the victims of imposture
in others) that drove us away, as
it was an undefinable terror which seized
both of us whenever we passed by the
door of a certain unfurnished room, in
which we neither saw nor heard anything;
and the strangest marvel of all was that
for once in my life I agreed with my wife,
silly woman though she be, and allowed
after the third night that it was impossible
to stay a fourth in that house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Accordingly, on the fourth morning I
summoned the woman who kept the
house and attended on us, and told her
that the rooms did not quite suit us, and
we would not stay out our week. She
said dryly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘I know why; you have stayed longer
than any other lodger. Few ever stayed a
second night; none before you a third.
But I take it that they have been very
kind to you.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘They—who?’ I asked, affecting a
smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Why, they who haunt the house,
whoever they are; I don’t mind them; I
remember them many years ago, when I
lived in this house not as a servant; but
I know they will be the death of me some
day. I don’t care—I’m old and must die
soon anyhow; and then I shall be with
them, and in this house still.’</p>

<p class='c013'>“The woman spoke with so dreary a
calmness that really it was a sort of awe
that prevented my conversing with her
further. I paid for my week, and too
happy were I and my wife to get off so
cheaply.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You excite my curiosity,” said I;
“nothing I should like better than to
sleep in a haunted house. Pray give me
the address of the one which you left so
ignominiously.”</p>

<p class='c013'>My friend gave me the address; and
when we parted I walked straight toward
the house thus indicated.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is situated on the north side of Oxford
Street, in a dull but respectable
thoroughfare. I found the house shut up;
no bill on the window, and no response to
my knock. As I was turning away, a
beer-boy, collecting pewter pots at the
neighboring areas, said to me, “Do you
want any one at that house, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; I heard it was to be let.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let! Why, the woman who kept it
is dead; has been dead these three weeks;
and no one can be found to stay there,
though Mr. J—— offered ever so much.
He offered mother, who chars for him, one
pound a week just to open and shut the
windows, and she would not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would not! and why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The house is haunted; and the old
woman who kept it was found dead in
her bed with her eyes wide open. They
say the devil strangled her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pooh! You speak of Mr. J——. Is
he the owner of the house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where does he live?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In G—— Street, No. —.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is he—in any business?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir, nothing particular; a single
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I gave the pot-boy the gratuity earned
by his liberal information, and proceeded
to Mr. J—— in G—— Street, which was
close by the street that boasted the
haunted house. I was lucky enough to
find Mr. J—— at home; an elderly man
with intelligent countenance and prepossessing
manners.</p>

<p class='c013'>I communicated my name and my business
frankly. I said I heard the house
was considered to be haunted; that I had
a strong desire to examine a house with
so equivocal a reputation; that I should
be greatly obliged if he would allow me
to hire it, though only for a night. I
was willing to pay for that privilege
whatever he might be inclined to ask.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir,” said Mr. J——, with great courtesy,
“the house is at your service for as
short or as long a time as you please.
Rent is out of the question; the obligation
will be on my side, should you be
able to discover the cause of the strange
phenomena which at present deprive it
of all value. I cannot let it, for I cannot
even get a servant to keep it in order or
answer the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unluckily, the house is haunted, if I
may use that expression, not only by
night but by day; though at night the disturbances
are of a more unpleasant and
sometimes of a more alarming character.
The poor old woman who died in it three
weeks ago was a pauper whom I took out
of a workhouse; for in her childhood she
had been known to some of my family,
and had once been in such good circumstances
that she had rented that house
of my uncle. She was a woman of superior
education and strong mind, and
was the only person I could ever induce
to remain in the house. Indeed, since
her death, which was sudden, and the
coroner’s inquest, which gave it a notoriety
in the neighborhood, I have so despaired
of finding any person to take
charge of it, much more a tenant, that I
would most willingly let it rent free for a
year to any one who would pay its rates
and taxes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long ago did the house acquire
this character?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That I can scarcely tell you, but many
years since; the old woman I spoke of
said it was haunted when she rented it,
between thirty and forty years ago. The
fact is that my life has been spent in the
East Indies, and in the civil service of the
East India Company.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I returned to England last year, on
inheriting the fortune of an uncle, among
whose possessions was the house in question.
I found it shut up and uninhabited.
I was told that it was haunted, and no
one would inhabit it. I smiled at what
seemed to me so idle a story.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I spent some money in repainting and
roofing it, added to its old-fashioned furniture
a few modern articles, advertised it,
and obtained a lodger for a year. He was
a colonel retired on half pay. He came
in with his family, a son and a daughter,
and four or five servants; they all left the
house the next day; and although they
deponed that they had all seen something
different, that something was equally terrible
to all. I really could not in conscience
sue, or even blame, the colonel for
breach of agreement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I put in the old woman I have
spoken of, and she was empowered to let
the house in apartments. I never had one
lodger who stayed more than three days.
I do not tell you their stories; to no two
lodgers have exactly the same phenomena
been repeated. It is better that you
should judge for yourself than enter the
house with an imagination influenced by
previous narratives; only be prepared to
see and to hear something or other, and
take whatever precautions you yourself
please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you never had a curiosity yourself
to pass a night in that house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; I passed, not a night, but three
hours in broad daylight alone in that
house. My curiosity is not satisfied, but
it is quenched. I have no desire to renew
the experiment. You cannot complain, you
see, sir, that I am not sufficiently candid;
and unless your interest be exceedingly
eager and your nerves unusually strong,
I honestly add that I advise you <i>not</i> to
pass a night in that house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My interest <i>is</i> exceedingly keen,” said
I; “and though only a coward will boast
of his nerves in situations wholly unfamiliar
to him, yet my nerves have been
seasoned in such variety of danger that
I have the right to rely on them, even in
a haunted house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. J—— said very little more; he took
the keys of the house out of his bureau,
and gave them to me; and, thanking him
cordially for his frankness and his urbane
concession to my wish, I carried off my
prize.</p>

<p class='c013'>Impatient for the experiment, as soon
as I reached home I summoned my confidential
servant—a young man of gay
spirits, fearless temper, and as free from
superstitious prejudice as any one I could
think of.</p>

<p class='c013'>“F——,” said I, “you remember in Germany
how disappointed we were at not
finding a ghost in that old castle which
was said to be haunted by a headless
apparition? Well, I have heard of a house
in London which, I have reason to hope,
is decidedly haunted. I mean to sleep
there to-night. From what I hear, there
is no doubt that something will allow itself
to be seen or to be heard—something
perhaps excessively horrible. Do you
think, if I take you with me, I may rely
on your presence of mind, whatever may
happen?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, sir; pray trust me!” said he,
grinning with delight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, then, here are the keys of
the house; this is the address. Go now,
select for me any bedroom you please;
and since the house has not been inhabited
for weeks, make up a good fire,
air the bed well; see, of course, that there
are candles as well as fuel. Take with
you my revolver and my dagger—so much
for my weapons—arm yourself equally
well; and it we are not a match for a
dozen ghosts, we shall be but a sorry
couple of Englishmen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I was engaged for the rest of the day
on business so urgent that I had not
leisure to think much on the nocturnal
adventure to which I had plighted my
honor. I dined alone and very late, and
while dining read, as is my habit. The
volume I selected was one of Macaulay’s
essays. I thought to myself that I would
take the book with me; there was so
much of healthfulness in the style, and
practical life in the subjects, that it would
serve as an antidote against the influences
of superstitious fancy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly, about half-past nine I put
the book into my pocket and strolled
leisurely toward the haunted house. I
took with me a favorite dog—an exceedingly
sharp, bold, and vigilant bull-terrier,
a dog fond of prowling about strange
ghostly corners and passages at night in
search of rats, a dog of dogs for a ghost.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a summer night, but chilly, the
sky somewhat gloomy and overcast; still
there was a moon—faint and sickly, but
still a moon—and if the clouds permitted,
after midnight it would be brighter.</p>

<p class='c013'>I reached the house, knocked, and my
servant opened with a cheerful smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All right, sir, and very comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” said I, rather disappointed;
“have you not seen nor heard anything
remarkable?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir, I must own that I have
heard something queer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?—what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The sound of feet pattering behind
me; and once or twice small noises like
whispers close at my ear; nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are not at all frightened?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I! not a bit of it, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the man’s bold look reassured me
on one point, namely, that, happen what
might, he would not desert me.</p>

<p class='c013'>We were in the hall, the street-door
closed, and my attention as now drawn to
my dog. He had at first run in eagerly
enough, but had sneaked back to the
door, and was scratching and whining to
get out. After I had patted him on the
head and encouraged him gently, the dog
seemed to reconcile himself to the situation,
and followed me and F—— through
the house, but keeping close at my heels,
instead of hurrying inquisitively in advance,
which was his usual and normal
habit in all strange places.</p>

<p class='c013'>We first visited the subterranean apartments,
the kitchen and other offices, and
especially the cellars, in which last were
two or three bottles of wine still left in
a bin, covered with cobwebs, and evidently,
by their appearance, undisturbed for
many years. It was clear that the ghosts
were not wine-bibbers.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the rest, we discovered nothing of
interest. There was a gloomy little back-yard,
with very high walls. The stones
of this yard were very damp; and what
with the damp and what with the dust
and smoke-grime on the pavement, our
feet left a slight impression where we
passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now appeared the first strange phenomenon
witnessed by myself in this
strange abode.</p>

<p class='c013'>I saw, just before me, the print of a
foot suddenly form itself, as it were. I
stopped, caught hold of my servant, and
pointed to it. In advance of that footprint
as suddenly dropped another. We
both saw it. I advanced quickly to the
place; the footprint kept advancing before
me; a small footprint—the foot of a
child; the impression was too faint thoroughly
to distinguish the shape, but it
seemed to us both that it was the print
of a naked foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>This phenomenon ceased when we arrived
at the opposite wall, nor did it repeat
itself when we returned. We remounted
the stairs and entered the rooms
on the ground floor—a dining-parlor, a
small back-parlor, and a still smaller third
room that had probably been appropriated
to a footman—all still as death.</p>

<p class='c013'>We then visited the drawing-rooms,
which seemed fresh and new. In the
front room I seated myself in an armchair.
F—— placed on the table the
candlestick with which he had lighted us.
I told him to shut the door. As he turned
to do so, a chair opposite to me moved
from the wall quickly and noiselessly, and
dropped itself about a yard from my own
chair, immediately fronting it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, this is better than the turning-tables,”
said I laughing; and as I laughed,
my dog put back his head and howled.</p>

<p class='c013'>F——, coming back, had not observed
the movement of the chair. He employed
himself now in stilling the dog. I continued
to gaze on the chair, and fancied I
saw on it a pale, blue, misty outline of a
human figure; but an outline so indistinct
that I could only distrust my own vision.
The dog was now quiet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Put back the chair opposite to me,”
said I to F——; “put it back to the wall.”</p>

<p class='c013'>F—— obeyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was that you, sir?” said he, turning
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I—what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, something struck me. I felt it
sharply on the shoulder, just here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No,” said I; “but we have jugglers
present, and though we may not discover
their tricks, we shall catch <i>them</i> before
they frighten <i>us</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>We did not stay long in the drawing-rooms;
in fact, they felt so damp and so
chilly that I was glad to get to the fire
up-stairs. We locked the doors of the
drawing-rooms—a precaution which, I
should observe, we had taken with all the
rooms we had searched below.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bedroom my servant had selected
for me was the best on the floor; a large
one, with two windows fronting the street.
The four-posted bedstead, which took up
no inconsiderable space, was opposite to
the fire, which burned clear and bright; a
door in the wall to the left, between the
bed and the window, communicated with
the room which my servant appropriated
to himself. This last was a small room
with a sofa-bed, and had no communication
with the landing-place; no other door
but that which conducted to the bedroom
I was to occupy.</p>

<p class='c013'>On either side of my fireplace was a
cupboard, without locks, flush with the
wall, and covered with the same dull-brown
paper. We examined these cupboards;
only hooks to suspend female dresses—nothing
else. We sounded the walls;
evidently solid—the outer walls of the
building.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having finished the survey of these
apartments, warmed myself a few moments,
and lighted my cigar, I then, still
accompanied by F——, went forth to complete
my reconnoiter. In the landing-place
there was another door; it was closed
firmly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir,” said my servant in surprise, “I
unlocked this door with all the others
when I first came in; it cannot have got
locked from the inside, for it is a——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Before he had finished his sentence, the
door, which neither of us was then touching,
opened quietly of itself. We looked
at each other a single instant. The same
thought seized both: some human agency
might be detected here. I rushed in first,
my servant followed. A small, blank,
dreary room without furniture, a few
empty boxes and hampers in a corner, a
small window, the shutters closed—not
even a fireplace—no other door but that
by which we had entered, no carpet on
the floor, and the floor seemed very old,
uneven, worm-eaten, mended here and
there, as was shown by the whiter patches
on the wood; but no living being, and no
visible place in which a living being could
have hidden.</p>

<p class='c013'>As we stood gazing round, the door by
which we had entered closed as quietly
as it had before opened; we were imprisoned.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the first time I felt a creep of undefinable
horror. Not so my servant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, they don’t think to trap us, sir;
I could break that trumpery door with a
kick of my foot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try first if it will open to your hand,”
said I, shaking off the vague apprehension
that had seized me, “while I open the
shutters and see what is without.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I unbarred the shutters; the window
looked on the little back-yard I have before
described; there was no ledge without,
nothing but sheer descent. No man
getting out of that window would have
found any footing till he had fallen on
the stones below.</p>

<p class='c013'>F—— meanwhile was vainly attempting
to open the door. He now turned
round to me and asked my permission
to use force. And I should here state, in
justice to the servant, that, far from
evincing any superstitious terror, his
nerve, composure, and even gaiety
amid circumstances so extraordinary,
compelled my admiration and made me
congratulate myself on having secured a
companion in every way fitted to the occasion.
I willingly gave him the permission
he required. But, though he was a
remarkably strong man, his force was as
idle as his milder efforts; the door did not
even shake to his stoutest kick.</p>

<p class='c013'>Breathless and panting, he desisted. I
then tried the door myself, equally in
vain. As I ceased from the effort, again
that creep of horror came over me; but
this time it was more cold and stubborn.
I felt as if some strange and ghastly exhalation
were rising from the chinks of
that rugged floor and filling the atmosphere
with a venomous influence hostile
to human life.</p>

<p class='c013'>The door now very slowly and quietly
opened as of its own accord. We precipitated
ourselves onto the landing-place.
We both saw a large, pale light—as large
as the human figure, but shapeless and
unsubstantial—move before us and ascend
the stairs that led from the landing
into the attics.</p>

<p class='c013'>I followed the light, and my servant
followed me. It entered, to the right of the
landing, a small garret, of which the door
stood open. I entered in the same instant.
The light then collapsed into a
small globule, exceedingly brilliant and
vivid; rested a moment on a bed in the
corner, quivered, and vanished.</p>

<p class='c013'>We approached the bed and examined it—a
half-tester, such as is commonly
found in attics devoted to servants. On
the drawers that stood near it we perceived
an old faded silk kerchief, with
the needle still left in the rent half repaired.
The kerchief was covered with
dust; probably it had belonged to the old
woman who had last died there, and this
might have been her sleeping-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had sufficient curiosity to open the
drawers; there were a few odds and ends
of female dress, and two letters tied
round with a narrow ribbon of faded yellow.
I took the liberty to possess myself
of the letters. We found nothing else in
the room worth noticing, nor did the light
reappear; but we distinctly heard, as we
turned to go, a pattering footfall on the
floor just before us.</p>

<p class='c013'>We went through the other attics (in
all four), the footfall still preceding us.
Nothing to be seen, nothing but the footfall
heard. I had the letters in my hand;
just as I was descending the stairs I distinctly
felt my wrist seized, and a faint,
soft effort made to draw the letters from
my clasp. I only held them the more
tightly, and the effort ceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>We regained the bedchamber appropriated
to myself, and I then remarked that
my dog had not followed us when we had
left it. He was thrusting himself close
to the fire and trembling. I was impatient
to examine the letters; and while I
read them my servant opened a little box
in which he had deposited the weapons
I had ordered him to bring, took them out,
placed them on a table close at my bed-head,
and then occupied himself in soothing
the dog, who, however, seemed to
heed him very little.</p>

<p class='c013'>The letters were short; they were dated—the
dates exactly thirty-five years ago.
They were evidently from a lover to his
mistress, or a husband to some young
wife. Not only the terms of expression,
but a distinct reference to a former voyage
indicated the writer to have been
a seafarer. The spelling and handwriting
were those of a man imperfectly educated;
but still the language itself was
forcible. In the expressions of endearment
there was a kind of rough, wild
love; but here and there were dark, unintelligible
hints at some secret not of
love—some secret that seemed of crime.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We ought to love each other,” was one
of the sentences I remember, “for how
every one else would execrate us if all
was known.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again: “Don’t let any one be in the
same room with you at night—you talk
in your sleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And again: “What’s done can’t be undone;
and I tell you there’s nothing
against us, unless the dead should come
to life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here was interlined, in a better handwriting
(a female’s), “They do!”</p>

<p class='c013'>At the end of the letter latest in date
the same female hand had written these
words:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lost at sea the 4th of June, the same
day as——”</p>

<p class='c013'>I put down the letters, and began to
muse over their contents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fearing, however, that the train of
thought into which I fell might unsteady
my nerves, I fully determined to keep my
mind in a fit state to cope with whatever
of marvelous the advancing night might
bring forth. I roused myself, laid the
letters on the table, stirred up the fire,
which was still bright and cheering, and
opened my volume of Macaulay.</p>

<p class='c013'>I read quietly enough till about half-past
eleven. I then threw myself dressed upon
the bed, and told my servant he might retire
to his own room, but must keep himself
awake. I bade him leave open the
doors between the two rooms. Thus alone
I kept two candles burning on the table
by my bed-head. I placed my watch beside
the weapons, and calmly resumed my
Macaulay. Opposite to me the fire burned
clear, and on the hearth-rug, seemingly
asleep, lay the dog. In about twenty minutes
I felt an exceedingly cold air pass
by my cheek, like a sudden draft. I fancied
the door to my right, communicating
with the landing-place, must have got
open; but no, it was closed.</p>

<p class='c013'>I then turned my glance to the left, and
saw the flames of the candles violently
swayed as by a wind. At the same moment
the watch beside the revolver softly
slid from the table—softly, softly—no visible
hand—it was gone. I sprang up, seizing
the revolver with the one hand, the
dagger with the other: I was not willing
that my weapons should share the fate
of the watch.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus armed, I looked round the floor:
no sign of the watch. Three slow, loud,
distinct knocks were now heard at the
bed-head; my servant called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; be on your guard.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The dog now roused himself and sat on
his haunches, his ears moving quickly
backward and forward. He kept his eye
fixed on me with a look so strange that
he concentered all my attention on himself.
Slowly he rose, all his hair bristling,
and stood perfectly rigid, and with the
same wild stare.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had no time, however, to examine
the dog. Presently my servant emerged
from his room; and if I ever saw horror
in the human face, it was then. I should
not have recognized him had we met in
the streets, so altered was every lineament.
He passed by me quickly, saying,
in a whisper that seemed scarcely to come
from his lips:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Run! run! It is after me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He gained the door to the landing,
pulled it open, and rushed forth. I followed
him into the landing involuntarily,
calling him to stop; but, without heeding
me, he bounded down the stairs, clinging
to the balusters and taking several steps
at a time. I heard, where I stood, the
street-door open, heard it again clap to.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was left alone in the haunted house.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was but for a moment that I remained
undecided whether or not to follow my
servant; pride and curiosity alike forbade
so dastardly a flight. I reentered my
room, closing the door after me, and proceeded
cautiously into the interior chamber.
I encountered nothing to justify my
servant’s terror.</p>

<p class='c013'>I again carefully examined the walls, to
see if there were any concealed door. I
could find no trace of one—not even a
seam in the dull-brown paper with which
the room was hung. How then had the
<span class='fss'>THING</span>, whatever it was, which had so
scared him, obtained ingress, except
through my own chamber?</p>

<p class='c013'>I returned to my room, shut and locked
the door that opened upon the interior
one, and stood on the hearth, expectant
and prepared.</p>

<p class='c013'>I now perceived that the dog had slunk
into an angle of the wall, and was pressing
close against it, as if literally striving
to force his way into it. I approached the
animal and spoke to it; the poor brute
was evidently beside itself with terror.
It showed all its teeth, the slaver dropping
from its jaws, and would certainly
have bitten me if I had touched it. It
did not seem to recognize me. Whoever
has seen at the Zoological Gardens a rabbit
fascinated by a serpent, cowering in
a corner, may form some idea of the anguish
which the dog exhibited.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finding all efforts to soothe the animal
in vain, and fearing that his bite might
be as venomous in that state as if in the
madness of hydrophobia, I left him alone,
placed my weapons on the table beside
the fire, seated myself, and recommenced
my Macaulay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Perhaps, in order not to appear seeking
credit for a courage, or rather a coolness,
which the reader may conceive I exaggerate,
I may be pardoned if I pause to
indulge in one or two egotistical remarks.</p>

<p class='c013'>As I hold presence of mind, or what
is called courage, to be precisely proportioned
to familiarity with the circumstances
that lead to it, so I should say
that I had been long sufficiently familiar
with all experiments that appertain to
the marvelous. I had witnessed many
very extraordinary phenomena in various
parts of the world—phenomena that
would be either totally disbelieved if I
stated them, or ascribed to supernatural
agencies.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, my theory is that the supernatural
is the impossible, and that what is
called supernatural is only a something
in the laws of nature of which we have
been hitherto ignorant. Therefore, if a
ghost rise before me, I have not the right
to say, “So, then, the supernatural is possible,”
but rather, “So, then, the apparition
of a ghost is, contrary to received
opinion, within the laws of nature, namely,
not supernatural.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, in all that I had hitherto witnessed,
and indeed in all the wonders
which the amateurs of mystery in our
age record as facts, a material living
agency is always required. On the Continent
you will still find magicians who
assert that they can raise spirits. Assume
for a moment that they assert truly, still
the living material form of the magician
is present; he is the material agency by
which, from some constitutional peculiarities,
certain strange phenomena are
represented to your natural senses.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accept, again, as truthful the tales of
spirit manifestation in America—musical
or other sounds, writings on paper, produced
by no discernible hand, articles of
furniture moved without apparent human
agency, or the actual sight and touch of
hands, to which no bodies seem to belong—still
there must be found the medium,
or living being, with constitutional peculiarities
capable of obtaining these signs.</p>

<p class='c013'>In fine, in all such marvels, supposing
even that there is no imposture, there
must be a human being like ourselves,
by whom or through whom the effects
presented to human beings are produced.
It is so with the now familiar phenomena
of mesmerism or electro-biology; the
mind of the person operated on is affected
through a material living agent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor, supposing it true that a mesmerized
patient can respond to the will or
passes of a mesmerizer a hundred miles
distant, is the response less occasioned
by a material being. It may be through
a material fluid, call it Electric, call it
Odic, call it what you will, which has the
power of traversing space and passing obstacles,
that the material effect is communicated
from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hence, all that I had hitherto witnessed,
or expected to witness, in this strange
house, I believed to be occasioned through
some agency or medium as mortal as myself;
and this idea necessarily prevented
the awe with which those who regard
as supernatural things that are not within
the ordinary operations of nature might
have been impressed by the adventures
of that memorable night.</p>

<p class='c013'>As, then, it was my conjecture that all
that was presented, or would be presented,
to my senses, must originate in some human
being gifted by constitution with the
power so to present them, and having
some motive so to do, I felt an interest
in my theory which, in its way, was rather
philosophical than superstitious. And I
can sincerely say that I was in as tranquil
a temper for observation as any practical
experimentalist could be in awaiting the
effects of some rare though perhaps perilous
chemical combination. Of course, the
more I kept my mind detached from fancy
the more the temper fitted for observation
would be obtained; and I therefore riveted
eye and thought on the strong daylight
sense in the page of my Macaulay.</p>

<p class='c013'>I now became aware that something interposed
between the page and the light:
the page was overshadowed. I looked up
and saw what I shall find it very difficult,
perhaps impossible, to describe.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a darkness shaping itself out of
the air in very undefined outline. I cannot
say it was of a human form, and yet
it had more of a resemblance to a human
form, or rather shadow, than anything
else. As it stood, wholly apart and distinct
from the air and the light around it,
its dimensions seemed gigantic; the summit
nearly touched the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>While I gazed, a feeling of intense cold
seized me. An iceberg before me could
not more have chilled me; nor could the
cold of an iceberg have been more purely
physical. I feel convinced that it was not
the cold caused by fear. As I continued
to gaze, I thought—but this I cannot say
with precision—that I distinguished two
eyes looking down on me from the height.
One moment I seemed to distinguish them
clearly, the next they seemed gone; but
two rays of a pale, blue light frequently
shot through the darkness, as from the
height on which I half believed, half
doubted, that I had encountered the eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>I strove to speak; my voice utterly
failed me. I could only think to myself,
“Is this fear? it is <i>not</i> fear!” I strove
to rise, in vain; I felt as weighed down
by an irresistible force. Indeed, my impression
was that of an immense and
overwhelming power opposed to my volition;
that sense of utter inadequacy to
cope with a force beyond men’s, which
one may feel <i>physically</i> in a storm at sea,
in a conflagration, or when confronting
some terrible wild beast, or rather, perhaps,
the shark of the ocean, I felt <i>morally</i>.
Opposed to my will was another
will, as far superior to its strength as
storm, fire, and shark are superior in material
force to the force of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now, as this impression grew on
me, now came, at last, horror—horror
to a degree that no words can convey.
Still I retained pride, if not courage; and
in my own mind I said, “This is horror,
but it is not fear; unless I fear I cannot
be harmed; my reason rejects this thing;
it is an illusion, I do not fear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a violent effort I succeeded at last
in stretching out my hand toward the
weapon on the table; as I did so, on the
arm and shoulder I received a strange
shock, and my arm fell to my side powerless.
And now, to add to my horror, the
light began slowly to wane from the candles;
they were not, as it were, extinguished,
but their flame seemed very
gradually withdrawn; it was the same
with the fire, the light was extracted from
the fuel; in a few minutes the room was
in utter darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>The dread that came over me to be
thus in the dark with that dark thing,
whose power was so intensely felt,
brought a reaction of nerve. In fact, terror
had reached that climax that either
my senses must have deserted me, or I
must have burst through the spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>I did burst through it.</p>

<p class='c013'>I found voice, though the voice was a
shriek. I remember that I broke forth
with words like these, “I do not fear, my
soul does not fear”; and at the same time
I found strength to rise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still in that profound gloom, I rushed
to one of the windows, tore aside the curtain,
flung open the shutters; my first
thought was, <span class='fss'>LIGHT</span>.</p>

<p class='c013'>And when I saw the moon, high, clear,
and calm, I felt a joy that almost compensated
for the previous terror. There
was the moon, there was also the light
from the gas-lamps in the deserted, slumberous
street. I turned to look back into
the room; the moon penetrated its shadow
very palely and partially, but still there
was light. The dark thing, whatever it
might be, was gone; except that I could
yet see a dim shadow, which seemed the
shadow of that shade, against the opposite
wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>My eye now rested on the table, and
from under the table (which was without
cloth or cover, an old mahogany round
table) rose a hand, visible as far as the
wrist. It was a hand, seemingly, as much
of flesh and blood as my own, but the
hand of an aged person, lean, wrinkled,
small too, a woman’s hand. That hand
very softly closed on the two letters that
lay on the table; hand and letters both
vanished. Then came the same three
loud measured knocks I had heard at the
bed-head before this extraordinary drama
had commenced.</p>

<p class='c013'>As these sounds slowly ceased, I felt
the whole room vibrate sensibly; and at
the far end rose, as from the floor, sparks
or globules like bubbles of light, many-colored—green,
yellow, fire-red, azure—up
and down, to and fro, hither, thither,
as tiny will-o’-the-wisps the sparks
moved, slow or swift, each at its own
caprice. A chair (as in the drawing-room
below) was now advanced from the
wall without apparent agency, and placed
at the opposite side of the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Suddenly, as forth from the chair, grew
a shape, a woman’s shape. It was distinct
as a shape of life, ghastly as a shape
of death. The face was that of youth,
with a strange, mournful beauty; the
throat and shoulders were bare, the rest
of the form in a loose robe of cloudy
white.</p>

<p class='c013'>It began sleeking its long yellow hair,
which fell over its shoulders; its eyes were
not turned toward me, but to the door; it
seemed listening, watching, waiting. The
shadow of the shade in the background
grew darker, and again I thought I beheld
the eyes gleaming out from the summit
of the shadow, eyes fixed upon that shape.</p>

<p class='c013'>As if from the door, though it did not
open, grew out another shape, equally
distinct, equally ghastly—a man’s shape,
a young man’s. It was in the dress of
the last century, or rather in a likeness
of such dress; for both the male shape
and the female, though defined, were evidently
unsubstantial, impalpable—simulacre,
fantasms; and there was something
incongruous, grotesque, yet fearful,
in the contrast between the elaborate
finery, the courtly precision of that old-fashioned
garb, with its ruffles and lace
and buckles, and the corpse-like aspect
and ghost-like stillness of the fitting
wearer. Just as the male shape approached
the female, the dark shadow
darted from the wall, all three for a moment
wrapped in darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the pale light returned, the two
fantoms were as if in the grasp of the
shadow that towered between them, and
there was a blood-stain on the breast of
the female; and the fantom male was
leaning on its fantom sword, and blood
seemed trickling fast from the ruffles,
from the lace; and the darkness of the
intermediate shadow swallowed them up—they
were gone. And again the bubbles
of light shot, and sailed, and undulated,
growing thicker and thicker and more
wildly confused in their movements.</p>

<p class='c013'>The closet door to the right of the fireplace
now opened, and from the aperture
came the form of a woman, aged. In
her hand she held letters—the very letters
over which I had seen <i>the</i> hand close; and
behind her I heard a footstep. She
turned round as if to listen, and then she
opened the letters and seemed to read:
and over her shoulder I saw a livid face,
the face as of a man long drowned—bloated,
bleached, sea-weed tangled in its
dripping hair; and at her feet lay a form
as of a corpse, and beside the corpse cowered
a child, a miserable squalid child,
with famine in its cheeks and fear in its
eyes. As I looked in the old woman’s face,
the wrinkles and lines vanished, and it
became a face of youth—hard-eyed, stony,
but still youth; and the shadow darted
forth and darkened over these fantoms,
as it had darkened over the last.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing now was left but the shadow,
and on that my eyes were intently fixed,
till again eyes grew out of the shadow—malignant,
serpent eyes. And the bubbles
of light again rose and fell, and in their
disordered, irregular, turbulent maze
mingled with the wan moonlight. And
now from these globules themselves, as
from the shell of an egg, monstrous things
burst out; the air grew filled with them;
larvæ so bloodless and so hideous that I
can in no way describe them except to
remind the reader of the swarming life
which the solar microscope brings before
his eyes in a drop of water—things transparent,
supple, agile, chasing each other,
devouring each other—forms like naught
ever beheld by the naked eye.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the shapes were without symmetry,
so their movements were without order.
In their very vagrancies there was no
sport; they came round me and round,
thicker and faster and swifter, swarming
over my head, crawling over my right
arm, which was outstretched in involuntary
command against all evil beings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometimes I felt myself touched, but
not by them; invisible hands touched me.
Once I felt the clutch as of cold, soft
fingers at my throat. I was still equally
conscious that if I gave way to fear I
should be in bodily peril, and I concentered
all my faculties in the single focus
of resisting, stubborn will. And I turned
my sight from the shadow, above all from
those strange serpent eyes—eyes that had
now to redden as if in the air of some
though in naught else around me, I was
aware that there was a will, and a will
of intense, creative, working evil, which
might crush down my own.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pale atmosphere in the room began
now to redden as if in the air of some
near conflagration. The larvæ grew lurid
as things that live in fire. Again the
room vibrated; again were heard the
three measured knocks; and again all
things were swallowed up in the darkness
of the dark shadow, as if out of that darkness
all had come, into that darkness all
returned.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the gloom receded, the shadow was
wholly gone. Slowly as it had been withdrawn,
the flame grew again into the
candles on the table, again into the fuel
in the grate. The whole room came once
more calmly, healthfully into sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two doors were still closed, the
door communicating with the servant’s
room still locked. In the corner of the
wall, into which he had convulsively
niched himself, lay the dog. I called to
him—no movement; I approached—the
animal was dead; his eyes protruded, his
tongue out of his mouth, the froth gathered
round his jaws. I took him in my
arms; I brought him to the fire; I felt
acute grief for the loss of my poor
favorite, acute self-reproach; I accused
myself of his death; I imagined he
had died of fright. But what was my
surprise on finding that his neck was
actually broken—actually twisted out at
the vertebræ. Had this been done in the
dark? Must it not have been done by a
hand human as mine? Must there not
have been a human agency all the while
in that room? Good cause to suspect it.
I cannot tell. I cannot do more than state
the fact fairly; the reader may draw his
own inference.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another surprising circumstance—my
watch was restored to the table from
which it had been so mysteriously withdrawn;
but it had stopped at the very
moment it was so withdrawn; nor, despite
all the skill of the watchmaker, has
it ever gone since—that is, it will go in a
strange, erratic way for a few hours, and
then comes to a dead stop; it is worthless.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing more chanced for the rest of
the night; nor, indeed, had I long to wait
before the dawn broke. Not till it was
broad daylight did I quit the haunted
house. Before I did so I revisited the
little blind room in which my servant and
I had been for a time imprisoned.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had a strong impression, for which
I could not account, that from that room
had originated the mechanism of the phenomena,
if I may use the term, which had
been experienced in my chamber; and
though I entered it now in the clear day,
with the sun peering through the filmy
window, I still felt, as I stood on its floor,
the creep of the horror which I had first
experienced there the night before, and
which had been so aggravated by what
had passed in my own chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>I could not, indeed, bear to stay more
than half a minute within those walls. I
descended the stairs, and again I heard
the footfall before me; and when I
opened the street-door I thought I could
distinguish a very low laugh. I gained
my own home, expecting to find my runaway
servant there. But he had not presented
himself; nor did I hear more of
him for three days, when I received a letter
from him, dated from Liverpool, to this
effect:</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>Honored Sir</span>—I humbly entreat
your pardon, though I can scarcely
hope that you will think I deserve it,
unless—which heaven forbid!—you
saw what I did. I feel that it will be
years before I can recover myself;
and as to being fit for service, It is
out of the question. I am therefore
going to my brother-in-law at Melbourne.
The ship sails to-morrow.
Perhaps the long voyage may set me
up. I do nothing now but start and
tremble, and fancy it is behind me. I
humbly beg you, honored sir, to order
my clothes, and whatever wages are
due to me, to be sent to my mother’s,
at Walworth: John knows her address.</p>

<p class='c007'>The letter ended with additional apologies,
somewhat incoherent, and explanatory
details as to effects that had been
under the writer’s charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>This flight may perhaps warrant a suspicion
that the man wished to go to Australia,
and had been somehow or other
fraudulently mixed up with the events
of the night. I say nothing in refutation
of that conjecture; rather, I suggest it
as one that would seem to many persons
the most probable solution of improbable
occurrences.</p>

<p class='c013'>My own theory remained unshaken. I
returned in the evening to the house, to
bring away in a hack cab the things I
had left there, with my poor dog’s body.
In this task I was not disturbed, nor did
any incident worth note befall me, except
that still, on ascending and descending
the stairs, I heard the same footfall in
advance. On leaving the house, I went
to Mr. J——‘s. He was at home. I returned
him the keys, told him that my
curiosity was sufficiently gratified, and
was about to relate quickly what had
passed, when he stopped me and said,
though with much politeness, that he had
no longer any interest in a mystery which
none had ever solved.</p>

<p class='c013'>I determined at least to tell him of the
two letters I had read, as well as of the
extraordinary manner in which they had
disappeared; and I then inquired if he
thought they had been addressed to the
woman who had died in the house, and
if there were anything in her early history
which could possibly confirm the
dark suspicions to which the letters gave
rise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. J—— seemed startled, and after
musing a few moments, answered:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know but little of the woman’s earlier
history, except, as I before told you,
that her family were known to mine. But
you revive some vague reminiscences to
her prejudice. I will make inquiries, and
inform you of their result. Still, even if
we could admit the popular superstition
that a person who had been either the
perpetrator or the victim of dark crimes
in life could revisit, as a restless spirit,
the scene in which those crimes had
been committed, I should observe that
the house was infested by strange
sights and sounds before the old woman
died. You smile; what would you say?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would say this: that I am convinced,
if we could get to the bottom of these
mysteries, we should find a living, human
agency.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What! you believe it is all an imposture?
For what object?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not an imposture, in the ordinary
sense of the word. If suddenly I were to
sink into a deep sleep, from which you
could not awake me, but in that deep
sleep could answer questions with an accuracy
which I could not pretend to
when awake—tell you what money you
had in your pocket, nay, describe your
very thoughts—it is not necessarily an
imposture, any more than it is necessarily
supernatural. I should be, unconsciously
to myself, under a mesmeric influence,
conveyed to me from a distance by a
human being who had acquired power
over me by previous <i>rapport</i>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Granting mesmerism, so far carried,
to be a fact, you are right. And you
would infer from this that a mesmerizer
might produce the extraordinary effects
you and others have witnessed over inanimate
objects—fill the air with sights and
sounds?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Or impress our senses with the belief
in them, we never having been <i>en rapport</i>
with the person acting on us? No. What
is commonly called mesmerism could not
do this; but there may be a power akin
to mesmerism and superior to it—the
power that in the old days was called
magic. That such a power may extend
to all inanimate objects of matter, I do
not say; but if so, it would not be against
nature, only a rare power in nature, which
might be given to constitutions with certain
peculiarities, and cultivated by practise
to an extraordinary degree.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That such a power might extend over
the dead—that is, over certain thoughts
and memories that the dead may still
retain—and compel, not that which ought
properly to be called the <span class='fss'>SOUL</span>, and which
is far beyond human reach, but rather a
fantom of what has been most earth-stained
on earth, to make itself apparent
to our senses—is a very ancient though
obsolete theory, upon which I will hazard
no opinion. But I do not conceive the
power would be supernatural.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me illustrate what I mean, from
an experiment which Paracelsus describes
as not difficult, and which the author of
the ‘Curiosities of Literature’ cites as
credible: A flower perishes; you burn it.
Whatever were the elements of that
flower while it lived are gone, dispersed,
you know not whither; you can never discover
nor re-collect them. But you can,
by chemistry, out of the burnt dust of
that flower, raise a spectrum of the
flower, just as it seemed in life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may be the same with a human
being. The soul has as much escaped you
as the essence or elements of the flower.
Still you may make a spectrum of it. And
this fantom, though in the popular superstition
it is held to be the soul of
the departed, must not be confounded
with the true soul; it is but the eidolon
of the dead form.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hence, like the best-attested stories
of ghosts or spirits, the thing that most
strikes us is the absence of what we hold
to be soul—that is, of superior, emancipated
intelligence. They come for little
or no object; they seldom speak, if they
do come; they utter no ideas above those
of an ordinary person on earth. These
American spirit-seers have published volumes
of communications in prose and
verse, which they assert to be given in
the names of the most illustrious dead—Shakespeare,
Bacon, heaven knows whom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Those communications, taking the
best, are certainly not of a whit higher
order than would be communications from
living persons of fair talent and education;
they are wondrously inferior to what
Bacon, Shakespeare, and Plato said and
wrote when on earth. Nor, what is more
notable, do they ever contain an idea that
was not on the earth before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wonderful, therefore, as such phenomena
may be (granting them to be
truthful), I see much that philosophy may
question, nothing that it is incumbent on
philosophy to deny, namely, nothing supernatural.
They are but ideas conveyed
somehow or other (we have not yet discovered
the means) from one mortal brain
to another. Whether in so doing tables
walk of their own accord, or fiend-like
shapes appear in a magic circle, or bodiless
hands rise and remove material objects,
or a thing of darkness, such as presented
itself to me, freeze our blood—still
am I persuaded that these are but agencies
conveyed, as by electric wires, to my own
brain from the brain of another.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some constitutions there is a natural
chemistry, and those may produce
chemic wonders; in others a natural fluid,
call it electricity, and these produce electric
wonders. But they differ in this from
normal science: they are alike objectless,
purposeless, puerile, frivolous. They lead
on to no grand results, and therefore the
world does not heed, and true sages have
not cultivated them. But sure I am, that
of all I saw or heard, a man, human as
myself, was the remote originator; and,
I believe, unconsciously to himself as to
the exact effects produced, for this reason:
no two persons, you say, have ever
told you that they experienced exactly the
same thing; well, observe, no two persons
ever experience exactly the same dream.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If this were an ordinary imposture,
the machinery would be arranged for results
that would but little vary; if it were
a supernatural agency permitted by the
Almighty, it would surely be for some
definite end. These phenomena belong to
neither class. My persuasion is that they
originate in some brain now far distant;
that that brain had no distinct volition
in anything that occurred; that what does
occur reflects but its devious, motley,
ever-shifting, half-formed thoughts; in
short, that it has been but the dreams
of such a brain put into action and invested
with a semi-substance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That this brain is of immense power,
that it can set matter into movement, that
it is malignant and destructive, I believe.
Some material force must have killed
my dog; it might, for aught I know, have
sufficed to kill myself, had I been as subjugated
by terror as the dog—had my intellect
or my spirit given me no countervailing
resistance in my will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It killed your dog! that is fearful!
Indeed, it is strange that no animal can
be induced to stay in that house; not
even a cat. Rats and mice are never found
in it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The instincts of the brute creation detect
influences deadly to their existence.
Man’s reason has a sense less subtle, because
it has a resisting power more supreme.
But enough; do you comprehend
my theory?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, though imperfectly; and I accept
any crotchet (pardon the word), however
odd, rather than embrace at once the
notion of ghosts and hobgoblins we imbibed
in our nurseries. Still, to my
unfortunate house the evil is the same.
What on earth can I do with the house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you what I would do. I
am convinced from my own internal
feelings that the small unfurnished room,
at right angles to the door of the bedroom
which I occupied, forms a starting-point
or receptacle for the influences which
haunt the house; and I strongly advise
you to have the walls opened, the floor
removed, nay, the whole room pulled
down. I observe that it is detached from
the body of the house, built over the small
back-yard, and could be removed without
injury to the rest of the building.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you think that if I did that——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You would cut off the telegraph-wires.
Try it. I am so persuaded that I am
right that I will pay half the expense if
you will allow me to direct the operations.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nay, I am well able to afford the
cost; for the rest, allow me to write to
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>About ten days afterward I received a
letter from Mr. J——, telling me that he
had visited the house since I had seen
him; that he had found the two letters
I had described replaced in the drawer
from which I had taken them; that he
had read them with misgivings like my
own; that he had instituted a cautious
inquiry about the woman to whom I
rightly conjectured they had been written.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seemed that thirty-six years ago (a
year before the date of the letters) she
had married, against the wish of her
relatives, an American of very suspicious
character; in fact, he was generally believed
to have been a pirate. She herself
was the daughter of very respectable
tradespeople, and had served in the
capacity of nursery governess before her
marriage. She had a brother, a widower,
who was considered wealthy, and who
had one child about six years old. A
month after the marriage the body of this
brother was found in the Thames, near
London Bridge; there seemed some marks
of violence about his throat, but they
were not deemed sufficient to warrant the
inquest in any other verdict than that of
“found drowned.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The American and his wife took charge
of the little boy, the deceased brother
having by his will left his sister the
guardian of his only child, and in the event
of the child’s death the sister inherited.
The child died about six months afterward;
it was supposed to have been neglected
and ill-treated. The neighbors deposed
to have heard it shriek at night.</p>

<p class='c013'>The surgeon who had examined it after
death said that it was emaciated as if
from want of nourishment, and the body
was covered with livid bruises. It seemed
that one winter night the child had sought
to escape; had crept out into the back-yard,
tried to scale the wall, fallen back
exhausted, and had been found at morning
on the stones in a dying state.</p>

<p class='c013'>But though there was some evidence of
cruelty, there was none of murder; and
the aunt and her husband had sought to
palliate cruelty by alleging the exceeding
stubbornness and perversity of the child,
who was declared to be half-witted. Be
that as it may, at the orphan’s death the
aunt inherited her brother’s fortune.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before the first wedded year was out,
the American quitted England abruptly,
and never returned to it. He obtained a
cruising vessel, which was lost in the Atlantic
two years afterward. The widow
was left in affluence; but reverses of various
kinds had befallen her; a bank
broke, an investment failed, she went into
a small business and became insolvent,
then she entered into service, sinking
lower and lower, from housekeeper down
to maid-of-all-work, never long retaining
a place, though nothing peculiar against
her character was ever alleged.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was considered sober, honest, and
peculiarly quiet in her ways; still nothing
prospered with her. And so she had
dropped into the workhouse, from which
Mr. J—— had taken her, to be placed in
charge of the very house which she had
rented as mistress in the first year of her
wedded life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. J—— added that he had passed an
hour alone in the unfurnished room which
I had urged him to destroy, and that his
impressions of dread while there were so
great, though he had neither heard nor
seen anything, that he was eager to have
the walls bared and the floors removed,
as I had suggested. He had engaged persons
for the work, and would commence
any day I would name.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day was accordingly fixed. I repaired
to the haunted house; we went into
the blind, dreary room, took up the skirting,
and then the floors. Under the rafters,
covered with rubbish, was found a
trapdoor, quite large enough to admit a
man. It was closely nailed down with
clamps and rivets of iron. On removing
these we descended into a room below,
the existence of which had never been
suspected.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this room there had been a window
and a flue, but they had been bricked
over, evidently for many years. By the
help of candles we examined this place;
It still retained some moldering furniture—three
chairs, an oak settee, a table—all
of the fashion of about eighty years
ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a chest of drawers against
the wall, in which we found, half rotted
away, old-fashioned articles of a man’s
dress, such as might have been worn
eighty or a hundred years ago, by a gentleman
of some rank; costly steel buckles
and buttons, like those yet worn in court-dresses,
a handsome court-sword; in a
waistcoat which had once been rich with
gold-lace, but which was now blackened
and foul with damp, we found five guineas,
a few silver coins, and an ivory ticket,
probably for some place of entertainment
long since passed away.</p>

<p class='c013'>But our main discovery was in a kind
of iron safe fixed to the wall, the lock of
which it cost us much trouble to get
picked.</p>

<p class='c013'>In this safe were three shelves and
two small drawers. Ranged on the
shelves were several small bottles of crystal,
hermetically stopped. They contained
colorless volatile essences, of what nature
I shall say no more than that they
were not poisons; phosphor and ammonia
entered into some of them. There were
also some very curious glass tubes, and
a small pointed rod of iron, with a large
lump of rock crystal, and another of
amber, also a lodestone of great power.</p>

<p class='c013'>In one of the drawers we found a miniature
portrait set in gold, and retaining the
freshness of its colors most remarkably,
considering the length of time it had probably
been there. The portrait was that of
a man who might be somewhat advanced
in middle life, perhaps forty-seven or
forty-eight.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a most peculiar face, a most impressive
face. If you could fancy some
mighty serpent transformed into man,
preserving in the human lineaments the
old serpent type, you would have a better
idea of that countenance than long descriptions
can convey; the width and flatness
of frontal, the tapering elegance of
contour, disguising the strength of the
deadly jaw; the long, large, terrible eye,
glittering and green as the emerald, and
withal a certain ruthless calm, as if from
the consciousness of an immense power.</p>

<p class='c013'>The strange thing was this: the instant
I saw the miniature I recognized a startling
likeness to one of the rarest portraits
in the world; the portrait of a man
of rank only below that of royalty, who
in his own day had made a considerable
noise. History says little or nothing of
him; but search the correspondence of
his contemporaries, and you find reference
to his wild daring, his bold profligacy,
his restless spirit, his taste for the
occult sciences.</p>

<p class='c013'>While still in the meridian of life he
died and was buried, so say the chronicles,
in a foreign land. He died in time
to escape the grasp of the law; for he
was accused of crimes which would have
given him to the headsman. After his
death the portraits of him, which had
been numerous, for he had been a munificent
encourager of art, were bought up
and destroyed, it was supposed by his
heirs, who might have been glad could
they have razed his very name from their
splendid line.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had enjoyed vast wealth; a large
portion of this was believed to have been
embezzled by a favorite astrologer or
soothsayer; at all events, it had unaccountably
vanished at the time of his
death. One portrait alone of him was
supposed to have escaped the general destruction;
I had seen it in the house
of a collector some months before. It had
made on me a wonderful impression, as
it does on all who behold it—a face never
to be forgotten; and there was that face
in the miniature that lay within my hand.
True that in the miniature the man was
a few years older than in the portrait I
had seen, or than the original was even
at the time of his death. But a few
years!—why, between the date in which
flourished that direful noble and the date
in which the miniature was evidently
painted there was an interval of more
than two centuries. While I was thus
gazing, silent and wondering, Mr. J——
said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But is it possible? I have known
this man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How? where?” cried I.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In India. He was high in the confidence
of the Rajah of ——, and well-nigh
drew him into a revolt which would have
lost the Rajah his dominions. The man
was a Frenchman; his name De V——;
clever, bold, lawless; we insisted on his
dismissal and banishment. It must be the
same man, no two faces like his, yet this
miniature seems nearly a hundred years
old.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mechanically I turned round the miniature
to examine the back of it, and on the
back was engraved a pentacle; in the middle
of the pentacle a ladder, and the third
step of the ladder was formed by the date
1765. Examining still more minutely, I
detected a spring; this, on being pressed,
opened the back of the miniature as a
lid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within-side the lid were engraved:
“Mariana, to thee. Be faithful in life
and in death to ——.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here follows a name that I will not
mention, but it was not unfamiliar to me.
I had heard it spoken of by old men in
my childhood as the name borne by a
dazzling charlatan, who had made a great
sensation in London for a year or so, and
had fled the country on the charge of a
double murder within his own house—that
of his mistress and his rival. I said
nothing of this to Mr. J——, to whom reluctantly
I resigned the miniature.</p>

<p class='c013'>We had found no difficulty in opening
the first drawer within the iron safe; we
found great difficulty in opening the second:
it was not locked, but it resisted
all efforts, till we inserted in the chinks
the edge of a chisel. When we had thus
drawn it forth we found a very singular
apparatus, in the nicest order.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon a small, thin book, or rather tablet,
was placed a saucer of crystal; this
saucer was filled with a clear liquid; on
that liquid floated a kind of compass, with
a needle shifting rapidly round; but instead
of the usual points of a compass,
were seven strange characters, not very
unlike those used by astrologers to denote
the planets.</p>

<p class='c013'>A very peculiar, but not strong nor displeasing
odor came from this drawer,
which was lined with a wood that we
afterward discovered to be hazel. Whatever
the cause of this odor, it produced
a material effect on the nerves. We all
felt it, even the two workmen who were
in the room; a creeping, tingling sensation,
from the tips of the fingers to the
roots of the hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Impatient to examine the tablet, I removed
the saucer. As I did so, the needle
of the compass went round and round
with exceeding swiftness, and I felt a
shock that ran through my whole frame,
so that I dropped the saucer on the floor.
The liquid was spilt, the saucer was
broken, the compass rolled to the end of
the room, and at that instant the walls
shook to and fro as it a giant had swayed
and rocked them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The two workmen were so frightened
that they ran up the ladder by which we
had descended from the trapdoor; but,
seeing that nothing more happened, they
were easily induced to return.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile I had opened the tablet; it
was bound in plain red leather, with a
silver clasp; it contained but one sheet
of thick vellum, and on that sheet were
inscribed, within a double pentacle, words
in old monkish Latin, which are literally
to be translated thus:</p>

<p class='c014'>On all that it can reach within these
walls, sentient or inanimate, living or
dead, as moves the needle, so works
my will! Accursed be the house, and
restless the dwellers therein.</p>

<p class='c007'>We found no more. Mr. J—— burned
the tablet and its anathema. He razed
to the foundation the part of the building
containing the secret room, with the
chamber over it. He had then the courage
to inhabit the house himself for a
month, and a quieter, better conditioned
house could not be found in all London.
Subsequently he let it to advantage, and
his tenant has made no complaints.</p>

<p class='c013'>But my story is not yet done. A few
days after Mr. J—— had removed into
the house, I paid him a visit. We were
standing by the open window and conversing.
A van containing some articles of
furniture which he was moving from his
former house was at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had just urged on him my theory
that all those phenomena regarded as
supermundane had emanated from a human
brain; adducing the charm, or
rather curse we had found and destroyed,
in support of my theory.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. J—— was observing in reply, “that
even if mesmerism, or whatever analogous
power it might be called, could really
thus work in the absence of the operator,
and produce effects so extraordinary, still
could those effects continue when the operator
himself was dead? and if the spell
had been wrought, and, indeed, the room
walled up, more than seventy years ago,
the probability was that the operator had
long since departed this life”—Mr. J——,
I say, was thus answering, when I caught
hold of his arm and pointed to the street
below.</p>

<p class='c013'>A well-dressed man had crossed from
the opposite side, and was accosting the
carrier in charge of the van. His face,
as he stood, was exactly fronting our window.
It was the face of the miniature we
had discovered; it was the face of the
portrait of the noble three centuries ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good heavens!” cried Mr. J——;
“that is the face of De V——, and scarcely
a day older than when I saw it in the
Rajah’s court in my youth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Seized by the same thought, we both
hastened down-stairs; I was first in the
street, but the man had already gone. I
caught sight of him, however, not many
yards in advance, and in another moment
I was by his side.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had resolved to speak to him, but
when I looked into his face I felt as if
it were impossible to do so. That eye—the
eye of the serpent—fixed and held me
spellbound. And withal, about the man’s
whole person there was a dignity, an air
of pride and station and superiority that
would have made any one, habituated to
the usages of the world, hesitate long before
venturing upon a liberty or impertinence.</p>

<p class='c013'>And what could I say? What was it
I could ask?</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus ashamed of my first impulse, I
fell a few paces back, still, however, following
the stranger, undecided what else
to do. Meanwhile he turned the corner
of the street; a plain carriage was in waiting
with a servant out of livery, dressed
like a <i>valet de place</i>, at the carriage door.
In another moment he had stepped into
the carriage, and it drove off. I returned
to the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. J—— was still at the street-door.
He had asked the carrier what the stranger
had said to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Merely asked whom that house now
belonged to.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The same evening I happened to go
with a friend to a place in town called
the Cosmopolitan Club, a place open to
men of all countries, all opinions, all degrees.
One orders one’s coffee, smokes
one’s cigar. One is always sure to meet
agreeable, sometimes remarkable persons.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had not been two minutes in the
room before I beheld at table, conversing
with an acquaintance of mine, whom I will
designate by the initial G——, the man,
the original of the miniature. He was
now without his hat, and the likeness
was yet more startling, only I observed
that while he was conversing there was
less severity in the countenance; there
was even a smile, though a very quiet
and very cold one. The dignity of mien
I had acknowledged in the street was also
more striking; a dignity akin to that
which invests some prince of the East,
conveying the idea of supreme indifference
and habitual, indisputable, indolent
but resistless power.</p>

<p class='c013'>G—— soon after left the stranger, who
then took up a scientific journal, which
seemed to absorb his attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>I drew G—— aside.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who and what is that gentleman?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That? Oh, a very remarkable man indeed!
I met him last year amid the caves
of Petra, the Scriptural Edom. He is the
best Oriental scholar I know. We joined
company, had an adventure with robbers,
in which he showed a coolness that saved
our lives; afterward he invited me to
spend a day with him in a house he had
bought at Damascus, buried among almond-blossoms
and roses—the most beautiful
thing! He had lived there for some
time, quite as an Oriental, in grand style.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I half suspect he is a renegade, immensely
rich, very odd; by the by, a great
mesmerizer. I have seen him with my
own eyes produce an effect on inanimate
things. If you take a letter from your
pocket and throw it to the other end of
the room, he will order it to come to his
feet, and you will see the letter wriggle
itself along the floor till it has obeyed
his command. ’Pon my honor ’tis true;
I have seen him affect even the weather,
disperse or collect clouds by means of a
glass tube or wand. But he does not like
talking of these matters to strangers. He
has only just arrived in England; says
he has not been here for a great many
years; let me introduce him to you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly! He is English, then?
What is his name?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! a very homely one—Richards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what is his birth—his family?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do I know? What does it signify?
No doubt some <i>parvenue</i>; but rich,
so infernally rich!”</p>

<p class='c013'>G—— drew me up to the stranger, and
the introduction was effected. The manners
of Mr. Richards were not those of
an adventurous traveler. Travelers are in
general gifted with high animal spirits;
they are talkative, eager, imperious. Mr.
Richards was calm and subdued in tone,
with manners which were made distant
by the loftiness of punctilious courtesy,
the manners of a former age.</p>

<p class='c013'>I observed that the English he spoke
was not exactly of our day. I should even
have said that the accent was slightly foreign.
But then Mr. Richards remarked
that he had been little in the habit for
years of speaking in his native tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>The conversation fell upon the changes
in the aspect of London since he had
last visited our metropolis. G—— then
glanced off to the moral changes—literary,
social, political—the great men who
were removed from the stage within the
last twenty years; the new great men who
were coming on.</p>

<p class='c013'>In all this Mr. Richards evinced no interest.
He had evidently read none of
our living authors, and seemed scarcely
acquainted by name with our younger
statesmen. Once, and only once, he
laughed; it was when G—— asked him
whether he had any thoughts of getting
into Parliament; and the laugh was inward,
sarcastic, sinister—a sneer raised
into a laugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a few minutes, G—— left us to
talk to some other acquaintances who had
just lounged into the room, and I then
said, quietly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have seen a miniature of you, Mr.
Richards, in the house you once inhabited,
and perhaps built—if not wholly, at least
in part—in Oxford Street. You passed by
that house this morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Not till I had finished did I raise my
eyes to his, and then he fixed my gaze so
steadfastly that I could not withdraw it—those
fascinating serpent-eyes. But involuntarily,
and as if the words that translated
my thought were dragged from me,
I added, in a low whisper, “I have been
a student in the mysteries of life and nature;
of those mysteries I have known
the occult professors. I have the right to
speak to you thus.” And I uttered a certain
password.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well. I concede the right. What would
you ask?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To what extent human will in certain
temperaments can extend?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To what extent can thought extend?
Think, and before you draw breath you
are in China!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“True; but my thought has no power in
China.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give it expression, and it may have.
You may write down a thought which,
sooner or later, may alter the whole condition
of China. What is a law but a
thought? Therefore thought is infinite.
Therefore thought has power; not in proportion
to its value—a bad thought may
make a bad law as potent as a good
thought can make a good one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; what you say confirms my own
theory. Through invisible currents one
human brain may transmit its ideas to
other human brains, with the same rapidity
as a thought promulgated by visible
means. And as thought is imperishable,
as it leaves its stamp behind it in the
natural world, even when the thinker
has passed out of this world, so the
thought of the living may have power
to rouse up and revive the thoughts of
the dead, such as those thoughts <i>were
in life</i>, though the thought of the living
cannot reach the thoughts which the dead
now may entertain. Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I decline to answer, if in my judgment
thought has the limit you would fix
to it. But proceed; you have a special
question you wish to put.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Intense malignity in an intense will,
engendered in a peculiar temperament,
and aided by natural means within the
reach of science, may produce effects like
those ascribed of old to evil magic. It
might thus haunt the walls of a human
habitation with spectral revivals of all
guilty thoughts and guilty deeds once
conceived and done within those walls;
all, in short, with which the evil will
claims <i>rapport</i> and affinity—imperfect, incoherent,
fragmentary snatches at the
old dramas acted therein years ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thoughts thus crossing each other
haphazard, as in the nightmare of a vision,
growing up into fantom sights and
sounds, and all serving to create horror;
not because those sights and sounds are
really visitations from a world without,
but that they are ghastly, monstrous renewals
of what have been in this world
itself, set into malignant play by a malignant
mortal. And it is through the material
agency of that human brain that
these things would acquire even a human
power; would strike as with the shock of
electricity, and might kill, if the thought
of the person assailed did not rise superior
to the dignity of the original
assailer; might kill the most powerful
animal, if unnerved by fear, but not injure
the feeblest man, if, while his flesh crept,
his mind stood out fearless.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thus when in old stories we read of
a magician rent to pieces by the fiends
he had invoked, or still more, in Eastern
legends, that one magician succeeds by
arts in destroying another, there may be
so far truth, that a material being has
clothed, from his own evil propensities,
certain elements and fluids, usually
quiescent or harmless, with awful shapes
and terrific force; just as the lightning,
that had lain hidden and innocent in the
cloud, becomes by natural law suddenly
visible, takes a distinct shape to the eye,
and can strike destruction on the object
to which it is attracted.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are not without glimpses of a
mighty secret,” said Mr. Richards, composedly.
“According to your view, could
a mortal obtain the power you speak of,
he would necessarily be a malignant and
evil being.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If the power were exercised, as I have
said, most malignant and most evil;
though I believe in the ancient traditions
that he could not injure the good. His
will could only injure those with whom
it has established an affinity, or over
whom it forces unresisted sway. I will
now imagine an example that may be
within the laws of nature, yet seem wild
as the fables of a bewildered monk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will remember that Albertus
Magnus, after describing minutely the
process by which the spirits may be invoked
and commanded, adds emphatically
that the process will instruct and avail
only to the few; that <i>a man must be born
a magician</i>!—that is, born with a peculiar
physical temperament, as a man is born
a poet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Rarely are men in whose constitutions
lurks this occult power of the highest
order of intellect; usually in the intellect
there is some twist, perversity, or disease.
But, on the other hand, they must possess,
to an astonishing degree, the faculty
to concentrate thought on a single object—the
energic faculty that we call WILL.
Therefore, though their intellect be not
sound, it is exceedingly forcible for the
attainment of what it desires. I will imagine
such a person, preeminently gifted
with this constitution and its concomitant
forces. I will place him in the loftier
grades of society.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will suppose his desires emphatically
those of the sensualist; he has, therefore,
a strong love of life. He is an absolute
egotist; his will is concentered in
himself; he has fierce passions; he knows
no enduring, no holy affections, but he
can covet eagerly what for the moment
he desires; he can hate implacably what
opposes itself to his objects; he can commit
fearful crimes, yet feel small remorse;
he resorts rather to curses upon others
than to penitence for his misdeeds. Circumstances,
to which his constitution
guides him, lead him to a rare knowledge
of the natural secrets which may serve
his egotism. He is a close observer where
his passions encourage observation; he is
a minute calculator, not from love of
truth, but where love of self sharpens his
faculties; therefore he can be a man of
science.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose such a being, having by experience
learned the power of his arts
over others, trying what may be the
power of will over his own frame, and
studying all that in natural philosophy
may increase that power. He loves life,
he dreads death; <i>he wills to live on</i>. He
cannot restore himself to youth; he cannot
entirely stay the progress of death;
he cannot make himself immortal in the
flesh and blood. But he may arrest, for
a time so long as to appear incredible if
I said it, that hardening of the parts which
constitutes old age.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A year may age him no more than an
hour ages another. His intense will, scientifically
trained into system, operates,
in short, over the wear and tear of his
own frame. He lives on. That he may
not seem a portent and a miracle, he <i>dies</i>,
from time to time, seemingly, to certain
persons. Having schemed the transfer of
a wealth that suffices to his wants, he
disappears from one corner of the world,
and contrives that his obsequies shall be
celebrated.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He reappears at another corner of
the world, where he resides undetected,
and does not visit the scenes of his former
career till all who could remember
his features are no more. He would be
profoundly miserable if he had affections;
he has none but for himself. No good
man would accept his longevity; and to
no man, good or bad, would he or could
he communicate its true secret.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Such a man might exist; such a man
as I have described I see now before me—Duke
of ——, in the court of ——, dividing
time between lust and brawl, alchemists
and wizards; again, in the last century,
charlatan and criminal, with name
less noble, domiciled in the house at
which you gazed to-day, and flying from
the law you had outraged, none knew
whither; traveler once more revisiting
London with the same earthly passion
which filled your heart when races now
no more walked through yonder streets;
outlaw from the school of all the nobler
and diviner mysteries. Execrable image
of life in death and death in life, I warn
you back from the cities and homes of
healthful men! back to the ruins of departed
empires! back to the deserts of
nature unredeemed!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There answered me a whisper so musical,
so potently musical, that it seemed
to enter into my whole being and subdue
me despite myself. Thus it said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have sought one like you for the
last hundred years. Now I have found
you, we part not till I know what I desire.
The vision that sees through the
past and cleaves through the veil of the
future is in you at this hour—never before,
never to come again. The vision of
no puling, fantastic girl, of no sick-bed
somnambule, but of a strong man with a
vigorous brain. Soar, and look forth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As he spoke, I felt as if I rose out of
myself upon eagle wings. All the weight
seemed gone from air, roofless the room,
roofless the dome of space. I was not in
the body—where, I knew not; but aloft
over time, over earth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again I heard the melodious whisper:</p>

<p class='c013'>“You say right. I have mastered great
secrets by the power of will. True, by
will and by science I can retard the process
of years, but death comes not by age
alone. Can I frustrate the accidents which
bring death upon the young?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; every accident is a providence.
Before a providence snaps every human
will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shall I die at last, ages and ages
hence, by the slow though inevitable
growth of time, or by the cause that I
call accident?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By a cause you call accident.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is not the end still remote?” asked
the whisper, with a slight tremor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Regarded as my life regards time, it
is still remote.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And shall I, before then, mix with the
world of men as I did ere I learned these
secrets; resume eager interest in their
strife and their trouble; battle with ambition,
and use the power of the sage to
win the power that belongs to kings?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will yet play a part on the earth
that will fill earth with commotion and
amaze. For wondrous designs have you,
a wonder yourself, been permitted to live
on through the centuries. All the secrets
you have stored will then have their
uses; all that now makes you a stranger
amid the generations will contribute then
to make you their lord. As the trees and
the straws are drawn into a whirlpool, as
they spin round, are sucked to the deep,
and again tossed aloft by the eddies, so
shall races and thrones be drawn into
your vortex. Awful destroyer! but in destroying,
made, against your own will, a
constructor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And that date, too, is far off?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Far off; when it comes, think your
end in this world is at hand!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How and what is the end? Look east,
west, south, and north.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the north, where you never yet
trod, toward the point whence your instincts
have warned you, there a specter
will seize you. ’Tis Death! I see a ship;
it is haunted; ’tis chased! it sails on.
Baffled navies sail after that ship. It enters
the region of ice. It passes a sky
red with meteors. Two moons stand on
high, over ice-reefs. I see the ship locked
between white defiles; they are ice-rocks.
I see the dead strew the decks, stark and
livid, green mold on their limbs. All are
dead but one man—it is you! But years,
though so slowly they come, have then
scathed you. There is the coming of age
on your brow, and the will is relaxed in
the cells of the brain. Still that will,
though enfeebled, exceeds all that man
knew before you; through the will you
live on, gnawed with famine. And nature
no longer obeys you in that death-spreading
region; the sky is a sky of
iron, and the air has iron clamps, and the
ice-rocks wedge in the ship. Hark how
it cracks and groans! Ice will imbed it
as amber imbeds a straw. And a man has
gone forth, living yet, from the ship and
its dead; and he has clambered up the
spikes of an iceberg, and the two moons
gaze down on his form. That man is
yourself, and terror is on you—terror;
and terror has swallowed up your will.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I see, swarming up the steep ice-rock,
gray, grizzly things. The bears of
the North have scented their quarry; they
come nearer and nearer, shambling, and
rolling their bulk. In that day every moment
shall seem to you longer than the
centuries through which you have passed.
Heed this: after life, moments continued
make the bliss or the hell of eternity.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush!” said the whisper. “But the
day, you assure me, is far off, very far!
I go back to the almond and rose of Damascus!
Sleep!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The room swam before my eyes. I became
insensible. When I recovered, I
found G—— holding my hand and smiling.
He said, “You, who have always
declared yourself proof against mesmerism,
have succumbed at last to my
friend Richards.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is Mr. Richards?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone, when you passed into a trance,
saying quietly to me, ‘Your friend will
not wake for an hour.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>I asked, as collectedly as I could, where
Mr. Richards lodged.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At the Trafalgar Hotel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me your arm,” said I to G——.
“Let us call on him; I have something
to say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>When we arrived at the hotel we were
told that Mr. Richards had returned
twenty minutes before, paid his bill, left
directions with his servant (a Greek) to
pack his effects, and proceed to Malta by
the steamer that should leave Southampton
the next day. Mr. Richards had
merely said of his own movements that
he had visits to pay in the neighborhood
of London, and it was uncertain whether
he should be able to reach Southampton
in time for that steamer; if not, he
should follow in the next one.</p>

<p class='c013'>The waiter asked me my name. On my
informing him, he gave me a note that
Mr. Richards had left for me in case I
called.</p>

<p class='c013'>The note was as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>I wished you to utter what was in
your mind. You obeyed. I have therefore
established power over you. For
three months from this day you can
communicate to no living man what
has passed between us. You cannot
even show this note to the friend by
your side. During three months, silence
complete as to me and mine.
Do you doubt my power to lay on you
this command? Try to disobey me.
At the end of the third month the
spell is raised. For the rest, I spare
you. I shall visit your grave a year
and a day after it has received you.</p>

<p class='c007'>So ends this strange story, which I ask
no one to believe. I write it down exactly
three months after I received the above
note. I could not write it before, nor
could I show to G——, in spite of his
urgent request, the note which I read
under the gas-lamp by his side.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c016'>THE SIROCCO OF ITALY.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>Italy is visited by a hot wind from
the south which is known as the
“Sirocco.” This wind will run the temperature
in southern Italy up to 110
degrees Fahrenheit in the shade, and
has a most peculiar effect on the human
system, causing intense weakness and irritable
depression.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sirocco is said to be indirectly the
cause of more murders, and of quarrels
in which blood is shed, than any other
phenomenon in nature.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>WEATHER PROVERBS.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>The absence of dew for three days indicates
rain. Heavy dew indicates
fair weather. Clouds without dew indicate
rain. If there is a heavy dew and it
soon dries, expect fine weather; if it lies
long on the grass, expect rain in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>With dew before midnight, the next
day will surely be bright. If you wet
your feet with the dew in the morning,
you may keep them dry for the rest of
the day.</p>

<p class='c013'>If it rains before seven, ’twill clear before
eleven. Rains from the south prevent
drought, but rains from the west are
always best. If it rains before sunrise,
expect a fair afternoon. If it rains when
the sun shines, it will rain the next day.
Rain is likely to commence on the turn
of the tide.</p>

<p class='c013'>Marry the rain to the wind and you
have a calm. If rain commences before
daylight, it will hold up before 8 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>; if
it begins about noon, it will continue
through the afternoon; if it commences
after 9 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, it will rain the next day; if
the wind is from the northwest or southwest,
the storm will be short; if from the
northeast, it will be a hard one.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>THUNDER IN ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>An early English author writes:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thunders in the morning signifie
wynde: about noone, rayne; in the evening
great tempest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Somme wryte (their ground I see not)
that Sondayes thundre should brynge the
death of learned men, judges, and others;
Mondayes thundre, the death of women;
Tuesdayes thundre, pleantie of graine;
Wednesdayes thundre, much blodshede;
Thursdayes thundre, pleantie of shepe
and corne; Fridayes thundre, the slaughter
of a great man and other horrible
murders; and Saturdayes thundre, a generall
pestilent plague and great deathe.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>HOW TO USE A BAROMETER.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>The following rules are those which are
used by the Seawanhaka-Corinthian
Yacht Club in their very successful attempts
to forecast the weather with the
aid of the barometer.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Rising Barometer.—A rapid rise indicates
unsettled weather. A gradual rise
indicates settled weather. A rise with
dry air and cold air increasing in summer
indicates wind from the northward;
and if rain has fallen, better weather may
be expected. A rise with moist air and
a low temperature indicates wind and
rain from the northward. A rise with
southerly winds indicates fine weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Steady Barometer.—With dry air and
seasonable temperature indicates a continuance
of very fine weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>A Falling Barometer.—A rapid fall indicates
stormy weather. A rapid fall with
westerly wind indicates stormy weather
from the northward. A fall with a northerly
wind indicates storm, with rain and
hail in summer, and snow in winter. A
fall with increased moisture in the air and
heat increasing indicates wind and rain
from the southward. A fall with dry air
and cold increasing in winter indicates
snow. A fall after very calm and warm
weather indicates rain with squally
weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>The barometer rises for northerly
winds, including from northwest by north
to the eastward for dry or less wet
weather, for less wind, or for more than
one of these changes, except on a few
occasions, when rain, hail, or snow comes
from the northward with strong wind.</p>

<p class='c013'>The barometer falls for southerly wind,
including from southeast by south to the
westward, for wet weather, for stronger
wind, or for more than one of these
changes, except on a few occasions, moderate
wind, with rain or snow, comes from
the northward.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>COWS TELL RAIN.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>A sign of coming rain or strong wind
is evident when a herd of cows
gather together at one end of a pasture,
with their tails to windward. Again,
when cows are unusually frisky—so that
sedate old grandmother cows caper about
the field and butt imaginary objects with
their horns, while they fling up their heels—often
storms are in the air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cows are sometimes thus playful in the
witching hours of twilight, to the terror
of nervous ladies who must cross their
pastures.</p>

<p class='c013'>But when in twilight cows follow one
another along a field path unpleasantly
close and gambol unpleasantly around
one, fear of a storm need not necessarily
add terror to the situation. For cows are
very inquisitive, and in the dusk of twilight
like to make careful investigation
of strangers, without meaning any offense.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cows show a sign of heat and its accompaniment,
annoying insects, when
they thus collect together, rubbing themselves
against each other, and one might
read in this a sign of fair weather
ahead.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>FIRE AS A BAROMETER.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>Willsford, in his “Nature’s Secrets”
(1658), tells us:</p>

<p class='c013'>“When our common fires do burn with
a pale flame, they presage foul weather.
If the fire do make a huzzing noise, it is
a sign of tempests near at hand. When
the fire sparkleth. very much, it is a sign
of rain. If the ashes on the hearth do
dodder together of themselves, it is a
sign of rain. When pots are newly taken
off the fire, if they sparkle (the soot upon
them being incensed), it presages rain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the fire scorcheth, and burneth
more vehemently than it useth to do, it
is a sign of frosty weather; but if the
living coals do shine brighter than commonly
at other times, expect then rain.
If wood or any other fuel do crackle more
than ordinary, it is an evident sign of
some tempestuous weather neer at hand;
the much and suddain falling of soot presages
rain.”</p>

<h3 class='c016'>GOOSE-BONES AND PROPHECIES.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>The goose-bone predictions are perhaps
more closely watched in Kentucky
than anywhere else, and it may be called
the Kentucky weather prophet.</p>

<p class='c013'>We must take the breastbone of a last
spring’s goose—none other will do, for the
prophecy does not extend beyond the year
in which the goose is hatched. It must
be divided into three different parts,
which represent the three divisions of
winter.</p>

<p class='c013'>The breastbone of a goose is translucent,
but at places has cloudlike blots
upon it. These blots denote cold weather,
and the prophecy is made according to
their density and position.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>ORIGIN OF COLD WAVES OF AIR.</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c025'>Dr. Klein, in reference to the use of
daily weather reports, states that in
Europe, as in America, in all cases, the
reports of the weather westward of a
given station are of the greatest importance,
while reports from stations to the
east are, on the average, of minor importance
in making weather predictions.</p>

<p class='c013'>A southerly wind in the region of Ireland,
Scotland, or Norway indicates the
approaching side of an area of low barometer.
It is therefore a sign of a coming
change in the weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>A northerly wind in those regions indicates,
for Germany, that the pressure
of the air from the ocean is high, and can
be considered as a sign of steady pleasant
weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>The region of high barometer is generally
separated from oceans and from
equatorial regions by lofty chains of
mountains. The coldest and densest
stratum of air can therefore not flow
away toward the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>The area of greatest cold on this continent
is not prevented by any range of
mountains from extending southward and
eastward, but is only hemmed in on the
west by the Rocky Mountains. Thus
while the Pacific Coast is protected from
an overflow of very cold air, the whole
eastern portion of America becomes peculiarly
subject to it.</p>

<div class='double'>

<h3 class='c010'>LIBRA: THE SCALES.</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c011'>
    <div>SEPTEMBER 23d to OCTOBER 23d. CUSP: RUNS SEPTEMBER 23d to 29th.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c012'>The constellation Libra—the seventh
sign of the zodiac, and the middle
one of the Air Triplicity—is a cardinal,
sanguine, diurnal, airy, masculine
sign, governing the loins. The higher attributes
are inspiration and perception.</p>

<p class='c013'>A person born during the cusp, when
the sun is on the edge of the sign, does
not receive the full benefits of the individuality
of either Virgo or Libra, but
partakes of the characteristics of both.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a greater variety of disposition
among the Libra people than among
those of any other sign. They are energetic,
ambitious, and inspired. The inner
nature is receptive, intuitional, sensitive,
and poetical. They always finish things
in a careful, competent, and conclusive
manner. They keenly feel and can
closely imitate the acts and sentiments
of others, and can thus readily learn from
example.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their strong emotions and great imitative
ability make them well adapted for
the dramatic profession. When angry,
they leave nothing unsaid. Their nature
responds to all forms of ideality. As
students, they are fond of philosophical
and ethical and especially of mystical literature,
Many good linguists are found
in this sign.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Libra people have remarkable
foresight, and in the decision of most
matters they are correctly guided by
their intuitive faculty. This is especially
so in the buying or selling of commodities,
in which they can rarely be
defrauded.</p>

<p class='c013'>When overtaken by disaster they recover
quickly and go to work again with
redoubled vigor. The Libra women are
kind, constant, and merciful.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other type of Libra people is to be
found more among the men, who are cunning
in their business dealings and inconstant
in their affections.</p>

<p class='c013'>In physical appearance Libra subjects
are usually tall, slender, and well-formed,
with oval face, or languid expression of
countenance, and beautiful eyes. The
physical temperament will be sanguine-bilious
in Southern latitudes, and nervous-bilious
in Northern climates.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their most congenial friends will be
found among the Fire people (Aries, Leo,
and Sagittarius); next, with those born
under their own sign, and, third, with
those born under Aquarius.</p>

<p class='c013'>Libra people take things from a material
and literal standpoint; and though
their intuitive nature will often show
them the true side of the question, they
prefer to accept the conclusions of human
logic.</p>

<p class='c013'>Impatience is one of their chief faults.
They are prodigal of their strength and
talents, and scatter their forces in all
directions. They suffer through anger
and jealousy.</p>

<p class='c013'>When a Libra and a Sagittarius person
are united, the children will be very talented.
Children of Libra and Aquarius
will be stronger physically, and will possess
a keen intellect. These children are
quick to perceive the truth in anything,
and will make determined efforts to improve.
They have a natural genius for
invention, having a marked mechanical
ability over all the other signs. They
should be permitted to have their own
way when not entirely wrong. To circumscribe
a Libra child is to destroy its
genius.</p>

<p class='c013'>The governing planet is Venus, and the
gems are the diamond and the opal. The
astral colors are black, crimson, and light
blue. The flower is the violet.</p>

<p class='c013'>August and December are the most
favorable months, and Wednesday is the
lucky day in this sign.</p>

<p class='c013'>October, the eighth month of the old
Roman year, originally began in spring.
By the Julian arrangement it became the
tenth month, and had thirty-one days assigned
to it. By the Slavs this is called
“yellow month” from the fading of the
leaf; to the Anglo-Saxons it was known as
the Wyn-Monat (wine month), because it
was the month in which they pressed
grapes, also as Winter-fylleth, because at
this full moon (fylleth) winter was supposed
to begin. It corresponds partly
with the Vendémiaire and partly to the
Brumaire of the first French Republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some of the very old Saxon calendars
October is characterized by the figure
of a husbandman carrying a sack on
his shoulders and sowing of corn. In
others, less ancient, hawking is the emblem
of the month; and yet in more modern
times it has been represented as a
man clothed in a garment of the color
of decaying leaves, with a coronal of oak-branches
and acorns on his head, holding
in his left hand a basket of chestnuts,
medlars, etc., and in his right, Scorpio—<i>i.e.</i>,
the sign of the zodiac which the sun
enters on the twenty-third of October.</p>

<p class='c013'>The principal ecclesiastical feasts are
those of St. Luke, on the 18th; and St.
Simon and St. Jude, on the 28th.</p>

<p class='c013'>The late Senator Mark A. Hanna and
Mrs. Annie Besant were born under this
sign. Bernhardt, Modjeska, and Peg
Woffington are excellent illustrations of
the dramatic genius of the Libra people.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c006'>
    <div>Nearly Every Nation Has a Peculiar Manner of Spelling His Name—In Poland He is Ivan Schmittiweiski, and in Turkey Yoo Seef.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>Of all the families of the earth probably
there is none more numerous
than that of Smith, and of all the
Smiths in the world it seems that at least
fifty per cent have been christened John.
If the name were not so common we
should probably admire it and see it
through a glamour, as we do many other
names that are not half as solid and substantial.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it is, plain John Smith is not very
high-sounding; it does not suggest aristocracy.
It is not the name of any hero
in die-away novels; yet it is good and
honest. Transferred to other languages
it seems to climb the ladder of respectability.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus in Latin it is Johannes Smithus;
the Italian smoothes it off into Giovanni
Smithi; the Spaniards render it Juan
Smithus; the German adopts it as Hans
Schmidt; the French flatten it out into
Jean Smeets; the Russian turns it into
Jonloff Smitowski; the Icelanders say he
is Jahnne Smithson. Among the Tuscaroras
he becomes Tam Qua Smittia; in
Poland he is known as Ivan Schmittiweiski;
among the Welsh mountains they
call him Jihom Schmidt; in Mexico his
name is written Jontli F’Smitri; in
Greece he turns to I’on Sinikton; in
Turkey he is almost disguised as Yoo
Seef.</p>

    <div>“Magic Squares” Were Held in Veneration by the Egyptians and Pythagoreans, and They Constitute the Oldest Numerical Problems Known to Man—Bewildering Results Obtained by Simple Methods.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The art of arranging numbers in
the form of squares, so that the
sum of the various rows—vertical,
horizontal, and diagonal—would
in each case be the same, is, without
question, the oldest of mathematical puzzles.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Egyptians and Pythagoreans
held them in the greatest veneration—especially
the latter, who dedicated
them to the then known seven planets.</p>

<p class='c013'>The magic 34 square was probably
the strangest freak of figures known at
this time.</p>

<p class='c014'>This strange freak may be found in
Dürer’s “Melancholia,” engraved on copper
in 1514, being included in the series
of symbolical engravings of “The Death
of the Devil,” “The Knight on Horseback,”
etc.</p>

<p class='c015'>The aim in this instance, as shown by
ancient writings, was not only to obtain
the same total (34) in the ten rows of
four, but to discover as many symmetrical
combinations as possible giving
the same result. According to the ancients,
“symmetrical combinations which
no man could number” were to be found
in this arrangement of the numbers from
1 to 16, inclusive. As an example, take
16, 3, 5, and 10, or 2, 8, 9, and 15, or 1, 9,
16, and 8, and so on indefinitely. The result
is the same.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another unique example is the following:</p>

<p class='c014'>In this case the sum is 65, and can be
reached in an almost endless variety of
combinations. However, there is one
feature to be remembered in dealing
with this problem, and that is that the
central number (13) must be added to
each combination except in the straight
and diagonal lines. Thus: 20, 24, 2, 6, and
13, or 8, 12, 14, 18, and 13, etc., each make
the magic sum 65.</p>

<p class='c015'>The well-known “15 puzzle” is another
illustration of the surprising feats
which figures are sometimes made to
play. The problem being to arrange in
a square of three rows, three figures in
each row, the numerals, 1 to 9 inclusive,
in such a manner that each row—vertical,
horizontal, or diagonal—will total 15.
This is more difficult than appears at
first glance, unless you have the key,
which is: place 5 in the center, and let
the four corners be 2, 4, 6, and 8. The
rest is easy.</p>
